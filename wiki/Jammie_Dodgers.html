<h2>History</h2>
<p>Named after Roger the Dodger from The Beano comics,[2] Jammie Dodgers have been produced for over 50 years.[2] In 2011, the brand was re-launched under the "Dodgers" umbrella with two new products: Toffee and Choccie.</p>
<p>In November 2013, it was reported that Burton's Foods, the company that makes Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels, had been sold to Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan for £350m.[3]</p>
<p>A version of this biscuit is made in France under the name "Gateaux Sables Nappage Fraise" by Pat'Boul de Provence. This version is bigger (100&#160;mm (3.9&#160;in) diameter) and has three round holes through which strawberry jam is visible.</p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>The 2011 re-launch TV campaign received the "Best Biscuit Advert of 2011" reward from The Grocer magazine.[4] Burton’s launched a new advert for Choccie Dodgers in April 2012, during "Britain’s Got Talent", as part of a £4.5 million campaign.[5]</p>
