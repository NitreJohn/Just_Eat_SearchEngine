<title>Tirggel - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Tirggel</h1>
<p><b>Tirggel<i></b>
</i>
 are traditional Christmasbiscuits from Zürich, Switzerland.[1] Made from flour and honey, they are thin, hard, and sweet.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><i>Tirggel</i>
-like honey cakes were already popular in antiquity. The earliest known baking moulds for similar pastries date to 3rd millennium BC Mesopotamia.[2] The recipe is believed to have come to northern Europe with the conquests of the Roman Empire.[2] In what is today Switzerland, <i>tirggel</i>
 are said to have been used as paganoffertory cakes, cut in the shape of sacrificial animals.[3]</p>
<p><i>Tirggel</i>
 are first recorded in Zürich as <i>Dirgel</i>
 in 1461. They have been manufactured there ever since with elaborately carved wooden moulds depicting Biblical or regional themes.[2] More recently, the wooden moulds—four of which are exhibited in the Swiss National Museum—have been replaced by polycarbonate casts, which are easier to handle.[2]</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Tirggel dough is composed of flour, 29 percent honey,[1] some sugar and water;[4] although one source reports that it is or was made without sugar, which is taken to be an indication of the <i>tirggel</i>
's pre-Christian origins.[5]</p>
<p>The dough is pressed very thinly into elaborately carved moulds of varying shapes and sizes; the <i>tirggel</i>
 can be as large as windowpanes.[3] The biscuits are baked in a high-temperature oven at 400&#160;°C (752&#160;°F) for only 90 seconds[6] and require good timing to get right.[1]</p>
<h2>Consumption</h2>
<p>Because <i>tirggel</i>
 are hard and dry, they are best when sucked on for a while, which allows the honey flavour to become more pronounced.[1]</p>
<p><i>Tirggel</i>
 are also very durable. Swiss writer Emanuel Stickelberger reported in 1939 that "the <i>tirggel</i>
 has the admirable quality of not becoming stale, and the harder it gets, the more enjoyable is it to nibble on."[7] On account of their elaborate ornamentation, traditionally manufactured <i>tirggel</i>
 are often not eaten at all for months or years and are kept as decorations instead.[3]</p>
