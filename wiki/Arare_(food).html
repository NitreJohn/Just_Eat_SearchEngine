<title>Arare (food) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Arare (food)</h1>
<p><b>Arare<i></b>
</i>
(あられ?, which is named after graupel "snow pellets") is a type of bite-sized Japanesecracker made from glutinous rice and flavored with soy sauce. The size and shapes are what distinguish <i>arare</i>
 from senbei<i>.</i>
 The name is chosen to evoke snow pellets – smaller arare are similar in size and shape to snow pellets, though others can vary significantly in size, flavor and shape. Arare is also called kakimochi or mochi crunch in Hawaii where it was introduced in the 1900s.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>There are many different sizes, colors, and shapes of <i>arare</i>
. Some are sweet, and others savory. One, called <i>norimaki arare</i>
 (nori meaning an edible seaweed in the form of a dried sheet; maki meaning roll shape) is wrapped with dried nori seaweed. Another, <i>kaki no tane</i>
(柿の種?), takes its name from its resemblance to a persimmon seed. (<i>Kaki</i>
 is Japanese for "persimmon".) Kaki no tane are often sold with peanuts, a combination called <i>kakipī</i>
(かきピー?). These are a popular snack to accompany Japanese beer.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Japanese typically consume <i>arare</i>
 to celebrate the Doll Festival (<i>Hinamatsuri</i>
), on March 3, Girls' Day in Japan. The <i>arare</i>
 made during the festival are very colorful - pink, yellow, white, brown, light green, and so on. Regular <i>arare</i>
 can be bought throughout the year, but the colorful ones are only available around January to March in anticipation of the Doll Festival.</p>
<p><i>Arare</i>
 was brought to the U.S. by Japanese immigrants who came as plantation workers in the early 1900s. In Hawaii, the snack is often called <b>kakimochi<i></b>
</i>
 (fried rice paste) or <b>mochi crunch</b>
. In Hawaii, it is popular to mix <i>arare</i>
 with popcorn (some people mix in <i>furikake</i>
, too). The popular Hurricane popcorn includes both <i>arare</i>
 and <i>furikake</i>
 with the popcorn. Also popular in Hawaii is li hing<i> arare</i>
.</p>
