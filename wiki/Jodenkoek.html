<title>Jodenkoek - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Jodenkoek</h1>
<p>A <b>jodenkoek</b>
 (in Dutch, literally "Jew cookie", plural jodenkoeken) is a big, flat, round shortbreadcookie with a diameter of about 10 centimeters.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Claimed to have been first baked in the 17th century,[1] these cookies were advertised by bakeries as early as 1872.[2] Jodenkoeken were made famous by a baker called Davelaar, in Alkmaar, Netherlands. The Stam bakery in Alkmaar started selling jodenkoeken in 1883,[3] and Dirk Davelaar took over this bakery in 1924. By advertising in local newspapers and by offering the cookies through other stores, his jodenkoeken became a popular product. The company continues to bake them to this day. Similar products with the same name are produced by Lotus Bakeries and O'Lacy.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>Some producers still use the old name, <i>jodekoek</i>
, while others have changed the name of the product to <i>jodenkoek</i>
, after the new orthography of the Netherlands from 1996.</p>
<p>There are four different stories about the name of the cookies:</p>
<p>In the 1970s the name was thought to be discriminatory by some, and the manufacturer considered changing it, but ultimately decided against it.[4] Jodenkoeken are exported to England and China, but, because of the difficulty of the name explanation, the export product is called <i>Dutch Cookies</i>
.[5]</p>
<h2>Package</h2>
<p>In the beginning the cookies were sold in iron tin-plates with a yellow wrapper. Now jodenkoeken can also be bought in plastic tins with a purple wrapper. Because the cookies are in a tin-plate, they are packed air-tight so they remain fresh and crunchy.</p>
