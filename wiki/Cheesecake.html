<title>Cheesecake - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Cheesecake</h1>
<p><b>Cheesecake</b>
 is a sweet dish consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese (typically cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar; if there is a bottom layer it often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuit), graham crackers, pastry, or sponge cake.[1] It may be baked or unbaked (usually refrigerated). Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored or topped with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, fruit sauce, and/or chocolate syrup. Cheesecake can be prepared in many flavors, such as; strawberry, pumpkin, key lime, chestnut, or toffee.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>An ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in ancient Greece even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece.[2] The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician Aegimus, who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes (πλακουντοποιικόν σύγγραμμα—<i>plakountopoiikon suggramma</i>
).[3][4]Cato the Elder's <i>De Agri Cultura</i>
 includes recipes for two cakes for religious uses: <i>libum</i>
 and <i>placenta</i>
.[5][6] Of the two, placenta is most like most modern cheesecakes, having a crust that is separately prepared and baked.[7]</p>
<p>The earliest extant cheesecake recipe is found in <i>Forme of Cury</i>
, an English cookbook from 1390.[8] On this basis, chef Heston Blumenthal has argued that cheesecake is an English invention.[9]</p>
<p>Modern commercial American cream cheese was developed in 1872, when William Lawrence, from Chester, New York, while looking for a way to recreate the soft, French cheese Neufchâtel, accidentally came up with a way of making an "unripened cheese" that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came up with similar creations independently.[10]</p>
<p>The type of modern cheesecake that has an uncooked, cream-cheese filling on a cookie-crumb base is an American invention that differs greatly from English cheesecakes, which traditionally include dried fruits and spices and are baked in the oven.[8]</p>
<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>Almost all modern cheesecakes in the United States and Canada use cream cheese; in Italy, cheesecakes use ricotta; Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland use quark. Cheesecakes are most easily baked in a leak-proof springform pan, often paired with a water bath to more evenly distribute the heat.[11] Because of the high density of most cheesecakes, they continue baking for some time after removal from an oven.</p>
<p>The early Greeks considered it a cake. Some modern authors point to the presence of many eggs, the sole source of leavening, as proof that it is a torte. Still others claim that the separate crust, the soft filling, and the absence of flour prove that it is a custard pie.[12]</p>
<h2>National varieties</h2>
<p>Cheesecakes can be broadly categorized into two basic types: baked and unbaked. Each comes in a variety of styles determined by region:</p>
<p>Asian-style cheesecake flavors include matcha (powdered Japanese green tea), lychee, and mango. Asian-style cheesecakes are also lighter in flavor and are sometimes light and spongy in texture. Compared to its counterparts, Asian cheesecake is also considerably less sweet.</p>
<p>Australian cheesecakes are more commonly unbaked.[<i>citation needed</i>
] Common flavors include passionfruit, chocolate, raspberry, lemon, caramel, and vanilla.</p>
<p>Swedish cheesecake (<i>Ostkaka</i>
)</p>
<p>Bavarian baked cheesecake</p>
<p>Romanian cheesecake</p>
<p>Polish cheesecake (<i>Sernik</i>
)</p>
<p>making a cheesecake</p>
<p>The United States has several different recipes for cheesecake and this usually depends on the region in which the cake was baked, as well as the cultural background of the person baking it.[14] These cheesecakes are typically baked before serving.</p>
<p>Usually, cheesecake is made from cream cheese, eggs, and egg yolks to add a richness and a smooth consistency. It is baked in a special 13 to 15&#160;cm (5.1 to 5.9&#160;in) tall springform pan in many restaurants. Some recipes use cottage cheese and lemon for distinct texture and flavor or add a drizzle of chocolate or strawberry sauce to the basic recipe. A list of some variations of cheesecakes in the US is below:</p>
<p>Cheesecakes represented as being "New York style" are the most common variety in the United States; the term has considerable prestige. However, increasing distance from New York City itself tends to decrease the accuracy of the label, with cheesecakes made further from the city decreasing in density and richness and increasingly over-sweetened by New York standards. The genuine article is most likely to be found at Jewish-run delicatessens in large urban areas and high-end restaurants that make a point of serving gourmet-quality food.</p>
<p>Savory cheesecakes are also made, often for an hors d'oeuvre or served with accompanying salads.</p>
