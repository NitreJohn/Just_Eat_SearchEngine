) is a flat and dry type of bread or cracker, containing mostly rye flour. Crispbreads are light and keep fresh for a very long time. Crispbread is a staple food[2] and was for a long time considered a poor man's diet.[3] However, in recent years there has been renewed interest in crispbread in the Nordic countries.</p>

<h2>Brands</h2>
<p>Notable brands include Ryvita and Ry-Krisp, which was introduced in 1899.[4] The largest brand is Wasabröd with Finn Crisp being the second largest producer.[5]</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Crispbread has been baked in central Sweden since 500&#160;AD. It was made as round wafers with a hole in the middle so the bread could be stored on sticks under the roof.[6] Traditional crispbread was invented about 500 years ago.[<i>citation needed</i>
]Finland and Sweden have long traditions in crispbread consumption and crispbread has been known in most households since the 1800s. Traditionally, crispbreads were baked just twice a year; following harvest and again in the spring when frozen river waters began to flow.[7] Traditional western Finnish crispbread was (and still is) made in the form of a round flat loaf with a hole in the middle to facilitate storage on long poles hanging near the ceiling. Sweden's first industrial crispbread bakery, AU Bergmans enka, began its production in Stockholm in 1850.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Crispbread traditionally consists of wholemeal rye flour, salt, and water.</p>
<p>Today, however, many kinds of crispbread contain wheat flour, spices and grains, and is often leavened with yeast or sourdough, and milk or sesame seeds can be added.</p>
<p>In the case of unleavened crispbread, bubbles are introduced into the dough mechanically. Traditionally, this was done by mixing snow or powdered ice into the dough, which then evaporated during baking.[8] Today, the dough, which must contain a large amount of water, is cooled and mixed until bubbly.</p>
<p>Another method is to knead the dough under pressure in an extruder. The sudden drop in pressure then causes water to evaporate, creating bubbles in the dough.</p>
<p>Crispbread is only baked for a few minutes, at temperatures usually between 200 and 250&#160;°C.</p>
