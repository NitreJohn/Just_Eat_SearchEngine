<title>S'more - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>S'more</h1>
<p>A <b>s'more</b>
 (sometimes spelled <b>smore</b>
) is a traditional nighttime campfiretreat popular in the United States and Canada, consisting of a roasted marshmallow and a layer of chocolate sandwiched between two pieces of graham cracker.[1]<b>National S'mores Day</b>
 is celebrated annually on August 10.[2]</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Etymology and origins</h2>
<p><i>S'more</i>
 appears to be a contraction of the phrase "some more". The first published recipe for a S'more is found in a book of recipes published by the Campfire Marshmallows company in the early 1920s [3] where it was called a "Graham Cracker Sandwich." The text indicates that the treat was already popular with both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. In 1927, a recipe for "Some-Mores" was published in Tramping and Trailing with the <i>Girl Scouts</i>
.[4] Although the exact origin of the treat is unclear, reports about scouts from as early as 1925 describe them.[5] Merriam-Webster marks 1974 as the first use of S'more,[1] though recipes for "Some Mores" are in various Girl Scout publications until at least 1973. However, a 1956 recipe uses the exact name (S'Mores), and lists the ingredients as "a sandwich of two graham crackers, toasted marshmallow and 1/2 chocolate bar".[6] In 1968 Clarice Nelms provided the following recipe: Place a square of milk chocolate on a graham cracker. Toast a marshmallow and put on top of the chocolate, then a second graham cracker on top of the toasted marshmallow and squeeze and you will want "s'more".[7] Still earlier references exist, such as the camp recipes section in the 1963 "Outing Activities and Winter Sports Guide" stating "By now, readers who watch their weight are probably rising in protest since none of these recipes could conceivably be called low calorie. But after all, camping trips are supposed to be fun. Why not relax, enjoy yourself, and have s'more?"[8] and the 1958 publication "Intramural and recreational sports for high school and college" makes reference to Marshmallow toasts and S'more hikes[9] as does its related predecessor, the "Intramural and Recreational Sports for Men and Women" published in 1949.[10]</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Various confections containing graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow are often sold as some derivative of a s'more, but they are not necessarily heated or served in the same shape as the traditional s'more. The Hershey's S'mores bar is one example. Pop-Tarts also feature a s'mores variety.</p>
