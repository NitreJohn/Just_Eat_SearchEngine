<title>Rice Krispies Treats - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Rice Krispies Treats</h1>
<p><b>Rice Krispies Treats</b>
 (also called <b>Rice Krispies squares</b>
, <b>bars</b>
, <b>buns</b>
, <b>cakes</b>
, or <b>Marshmallow Squares</b>
) are a confection commonly made through binding Kellogg'sRice Krispies or another crisp rice cereal together using a combination of butter or margarine and melted marshmallows or marshmallow creme.[1] While traditionally home-made, Kellogg's began to market the treats themselves in 1995.</p>

<h2>History and Distribution</h2>
<p>Rice Krispies Treats are widely thought to have been invented in 1939 by Malitta Jensen and Mildred Day at the Kellogg Company[2] home economics department as a fund raiser for Camp Fire Girls.[3][4][<i>unreliable source?</i>
] Kellogg's began to commercially produce plain and chocolate-based treats under the trademark brand-names of "Rice Krispies Treats" (in the U.S. and Mexico), "Squares" (in Canada and the U.K.) and "LCMs" (in Australia and New Zealand) in 1995; however, other manufacturers had offered similar products under variant names (such as "Crisped Rice Treats" or "Marshmallow Treats") prior to this. Kellogg's also offers a themed breakfast cereal.[5]</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>The treat's binding has many common variations, such as the substitution of caramel for marshmallows, the addition of condensed milk, or the overall alternative usage of various corn syrup mixtures. Due to the mostly unaltered nature of the bulk of the finished product, the crisp rice cereal is easily substituted with other similar ingredients, especially other breakfast cereals, and other small food items (such as candies or nuts) are often added. As this allows them to be easily tailored to the occasion, they are very popular choices for theme parties and celebrations.</p>
