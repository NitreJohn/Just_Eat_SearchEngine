<h1>Qurabiya</h1>
<p><b>Qurabiya</b>
 (Azerbaijani: <b>قورابیه</b>
<i> Qurabiyə</i>
, Arabic: غرّيبة‎, Albanian: <i>Kurabie</i>
 or <i>Gurabie</i>
, Greek: κουραμπιές, Bulgarian: курабия, Persian: <b>قرابی</b>
 Ghorabi‎, Turkish: <i>Kurabiye</i>
) is a West Asian originating shortbread-type biscuit usually made with ground almonds.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region.[1]</p>
<p>Qurabiya cookies are said to originate in the Iranian Azerbaijani city of Tabriz, the provincial capital of the East Azerbaijan province. Though there are other sources that say the cookie is originally from Lebanon.[<i>citation needed</i>
]</p>
<h2>Regional variations</h2>
<p>In Tabriz, they are made of almond flour, sugar, egg white, vanilla, margarine and pistachio. It is served with tea, customarily placed on top of the teacup to make it soft before eating.</p>
<p>Kourabiedes or kourabiethes (Greek: κουραμπιέδες) resemble a light shortbread, typically made with almonds. Kourabiedes are sometimes made with brandy, usually Metaxa, for flavouring, though vanilla, mastika or rose water are also popular. In some regions of Greece, Christmas kourabiedes are adorned with a single whole spice clove embedded in each biscuit.[2] Kourabiedes are shaped either into crescents or balls, then baked till slightly golden. After they cool, they are usually rolled in icing sugar.[3] Kourabiedes are especially popular for special occasions, such as Christmas or baptisms (christenings).</p>
<p>Kurabiiki name of the Bulgarian cuisine and the many varieties of cookie, a popular sweet variety. Especially during the holiday season, and a variety of jams produced via the new year with powdered sugar cookies decorated with cute shapes are called maslenki.</p>
<p>Polvorón, from the Spanish word for dust, (Cebuano: <i>polboron</i>
; Tagalog: <i>pulburon</i>
) is a type of Andalusianshortbread popular in Spain and Latin America and other ex-Spanish colonies such as the Philippines during Christmas. Polvorones are made of flour, sugar, milk, and nuts, but they also include pig fat. They were traditionally produced for the Christmas season from September to January but are now often available year round. There are about 70 factories in Andalusia that are part of a syndicate that produce polvorones and mantecados.[4] Mantecado is a similar Spanish shortbread. The name <i>mantecado</i>
 comes from <i>manteca de cerdo iberico</i>
 (fat of Iberian pig) with which they are made. These days there are options different from animal fat, like mantecado made with olive oil.</p>
<p>In Mexico, these are traditionally served at weddings and celebrations. The cookies themselves are small rolls usually made with pecans. They are known in the United States as <i>Mexican wedding cookies</i>
.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, a number of local variants on the traditional <i>polvorón</i>
 recipe have been made. Well known variants include polvorón with <i>casuy</i>
 (cashew), and polvorón with <i>pinipig</i>
 (beaten young green rice). There's even strawberry, chocolate and cookies-and-cream polvorón.</p>
<p>Sometimes called Pan de Polvo, it is made with anise in the south Texas region.</p>
