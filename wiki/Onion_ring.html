<title>Onion ring - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Onion ring</h1>
<p><b>Onion rings</b>
 are a form of snack or side dish commonly found in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and some parts of Asia. They generally consist of a cross-sectional "ring" of onion (the circular structure of which lends itself well to this method of preparation) dipped in batter or bread crumbs and then deep fried; a variant is made with onion paste. Whole onion rings make for better presentation through a variety of sizes, while those made from a paste offer quantity through consistent size. Consumers of whole onion rings run the risk of pulling the onion out of the batter if they fail to cut it all the way through with their teeth; onion rings made of onion paste break apart easily, while oil absorbency diminishes the onion taste. Onion rings are sometimes accompanied by condiments including ketchup, mayonnaise or other sauces.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The exact origins of the onion ring are unknown, but in 1933 a recipe for deep-fried onion rings that are dipped in milk then dredged in flour appeared in a Crisco advertisement in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>
.[1]</p>
<p>A recipe for French Fried Onions may have appeared in the Middletown, New York<i>Daily Times</i>
 on 13 January 1910. It does not claim to be the originator of the recipe.[2]</p>
<p>One claimant to the invention of the onion ring is the Kirbys Pig Stand restaurant chain, founded in Oak Cliff, Texas, in the early 1920s. The once-thriving chain, whose heyday in the 1940s saw over 100 locations across the United States, also claims to be the originator of Texas toast.[3]</p>
<p>The restaurant A&amp;W is credited with popularizing the onion rings in fast food restaurants, introducing it to its menu in the 1960s.</p>
<p>John Mollard's 1802 cookbook "The Art of Cookery Made Easy and Refined" (page 152) includes a recipe called "Fried Onions with Parmezan Cheese." The recipe suggests cutting onions into 1/2" rings, dipping them into a batter made of flour, cream, salt and pepper, and Parmesan cheese, and then deep frying them in "boiling" lard. It further suggests serving them with a sauce made of melted butter and mustard.[4]</p>
