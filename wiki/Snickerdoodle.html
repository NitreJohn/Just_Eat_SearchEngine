<title>Snickerdoodle - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Snickerdoodle</h1>
<p>A <b>snickerdoodle</b>
 is a type of cookie made with butter or oil, sugar, and flour, and rolled in cinnamon sugar. Eggs may also sometimes be used as an ingredient, with cream of tartar and baking soda added to leaven the dough. Snickerdoodles are characterized by a cracked surface and can be crisp or soft depending on preference.</p>
<p>Snickerdoodles are often referred to as "sugar cookies". However, traditional sugar cookies are often rolled in white sugar whereas snickerdoodles are rolled in a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p><i>The Joy of Cooking</i>
 claims that snickerdoodles are probably German in origin, and that the name is a corruption of the German word <i>Schneckennudel</i>
 ("snail noodles"), a kind of pastry.[1] It is also possible that the name is simply a nonsense word with no particular meaning, originating from a New England tradition of whimsical cookie names.[2][3]</p>
<h2>Food trends</h2>
<p>In more recent times, the Snickerdoodle cookie has transformed into a popular flavor of desserts, sweets, drinks, etc. Big brands have taken the simple dessert and turned them into their own original products. For example, General Mills created a Snickerdoodle flavored Chex MixMuddy Buddies to their snack line.[4] During the 2014 holiday season, Dunkin' Donuts unveiled a Snickerdoodle Cookie Latte on their holiday menu.[5] In addition to a Snickerdoodle latte, Nestl√©Coffee-Mate introduced their take on the cookie in the form of a coffee creamer.[6] Brands such as Braum's Ice Cream[7] and Prairie Farms[8] have dedicated an ice cream flavor to the popular cookie.</p>
<h2>Commercial products</h2>
<p>The Snickerdoodle has also become popular in non-edible products. In 2014, Bath and Body Works launched their "Made with Love" holiday collection.[9] This collection included a Snickerdoodle scented candle. However, this scent failed to gain popularity.[10] In addition, the skin care company Philosophy, Inc. released a Snickerdoodle scented body wash and shampoo in their "Twas the Night Before Christmas" collection.[11] Similar to the Bath and Body Works candle, this scent has been discontinued since it is unable to be found on retailer sites besides resellers like Amazon and eBay.[12]</p>
