<h1>Dobos torte</h1>
<p><b>Dobos torte</b>
 or <b>Dobosh</b>
 (pronounced&#160;[ˈdoboʃ], Hungarian: <i>Dobos torta</i>
) is a Hungariansponge cake layered with chocolatebuttercream and topped with caramel. The five-layer pastry is named after its inventor, Hungarian confectioner József C. Dobos, who aimed to create a cake that would last longer than other pastries in an age when cooling techniques were limited.[1] The round sides of the cake are coated with ground hazelnuts, chestnuts, walnuts, or almonds, and the caramel topping helps keep it from drying out.</p>
<p>The name is also sometimes spelled <b>Dobos-torta</b>
 or <b>Dobostorta</b>
.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dobosh or Dobos Torte (type of cake) was first introduced at the <i>National General Exhibition of Budapest</i>
 in 1885; Franz Joseph I and his Empress Elisabeth were among the first to taste it. The cake soon became popular throughout Europe as it was different from all others. It was simple but elegant, as opposed to the multi-layer, flaming cakes of the age. Its other secret was its use of fine buttercream, which was very little known at the time; cake fillings and frostings were usually made with cooked pastry cream or whipped cream. The chocolate buttercream and the batter of the cake were both invented by Jozsef C. Dobos.</p>
<p>Dobos travelled around Europe and introduced the cake wherever he went. For a long time he kept the recipe confidential, until 1906 when he retired and gave the original recipe to the <i>Budapest Confectioners' and Gingerbread Makers' Chamber of Industry</i>
, providing that every member of the chamber can use it freely.</p>
<p>Dobos Torte is known everywhere in the world and there are more than one hundred recipe variations. It is a commonly made torte in the upscale hotels, restaurants, and pastry shops of the world.</p>
