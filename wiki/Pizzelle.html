<title>Pizzelle - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Pizzelle</h1>
<p><b>Pizzelle<i></b>
</i>
 (pronounced with <b>ts</b>
 sound, like "pizza") (singular <i>pizzella</i>
) are traditional Italian waffle cookies made from flour, eggs, sugar, butter or vegetable oil, and flavoring (usually anise or anisette, but also vanilla or lemon zest). Pizzelle can be hard and crisp or soft and chewy depending on the ingredients and method of preparation.</p>
<p>Pizzelle were originally made in Ortona, in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. The name comes from the Italian word for "round" and "flat" (<i>pizze</i>
); this is also the meaning of the word <i>pizza</i>
. Many other cultures have developed a pizzelle-type cookie as part of their culture (for example, the Norwegian Krumkake). It is known to be one of the oldest cookies, and is believed to have developed from the ancient Roman <i>crustulum</i>
.[1] Pizzelle are known as <b>ferratelle<i></b>
</i>
 in the Lazio region of Italy. In Molise they may be called ferratelle, <b>cancelle<i></b>
</i>
, or pizzelle.[1]</p>
<p>The cookie dough or batter is put into a pizzelle iron, which resembles a small variant of the popular waffle iron. The pizzelle iron is held by hand over a hot burner on the stovetop, although some models are electric and require no stove. Typically, the iron stamps a snowflake pattern onto both sides of the thin golden-brown cookie, which has a crisp texture once it is cooled. There are also several brands of ready-made pizzelle available in stores.</p>
<p>Pizzelle are popular during Christmas and Easter. They are often found at Italian weddings, alongside other traditional pastries such as cannoli and traditional Italian cookies.</p>
<p>It is also common for two pizzelle to be sandwiched with cannoli cream (ricotta blended with sugar) or hazelnut spread. Pizzelle, while still warm, can also be rolled using a wooden dowel to create cannoli shells.</p>
