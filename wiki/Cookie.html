<title>Cookie - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Cookie</h1>
<p>In the United States and Canada a <b>cookie</b>
 is a small, flat, sweet baked treat, usually containing flour, eggs, sugar, and either butter, cooking oil or another oil or fat, and often including ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips or nuts. Cookies may be mass-produced, made in small bakeries or home-made. Cookie variants include using two thin cookies with a creme filling (e.g., Oreos) and dipping the cookie in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea.</p>
<p>In many other English-speaking countries cookies are called <b>biscuits</b>
.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>In most English-speaking countries outside North America, including the United Kingdom, the most common word for this type of treat is <b>biscuit</b>
 and the term <b>cookie</b>
 is often used to describe only certain types of biscuits. However, in many regions both terms are used.</p>
<p>In Scotland the term <b>cookie</b>
 is sometimes used to describe a plain bun.[2]</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>Its American name derives from the Dutch word <i>koekje</i>
 or more precisely its informal, dialect variant <i>koekie</i>
[3] which means <i>little cake,</i>
 and arrived in American English with the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, in the early 1600s.</p>
<p>According to the Scottish National Dictionary, its Scottish name derives from the diminutive form (+ suffix <i>-ie</i>
) of the word <i>cook</i>
, giving the Middle Scots<i>cookie</i>
, <i>cooky</i>
 or <i>cu(c)kie</i>
. It also gives an alternative etymology, from the Dutch word <i>koekje</i>
, the diminutive of <i>koek</i>
, a cake. There was much trade and cultural contact across the North Sea between the Low Countries and Scotland during the Middle Ages, which can also be seen in the history of curling and, perhaps, golf.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.</p>
<p>A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called "batter"[4]) as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles – responsible for a cake's fluffiness – to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, egg yolks, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.</p>
<p>Oils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not sink into it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they deal with travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards.[5]</p>
<p>Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region.[1] They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors.</p>
<p>With global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion, a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.</p>
<p>Cookies came to America through the Dutch in New Amsterdam in the late 1620s. The Dutch word "koekje" was Anglicized to "cookie" or <b>cooky</b>
. The earliest reference to cookies in America is in 1703, when "The Dutch in New York provided...'in 1703...at a funeral 800 cookies...'"[6]</p>
<p>The most common modern cookie, given its style by the creaming of butter and sugar, was not common until the 18th century.[7]</p>
<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>Cookies are broadly classified according to how they are formed, including at least these categories:</p>
<p>Cookies also may be decorated with an icing, especially chocolate, and closely resemble a type of confectionery.</p>
<h2>Notable varieties</h2>
<p>A variety of cookies, including gingerbread men and drop and molded cookies</p>
<p>A cookie cake is a large cookie that can be decorated with icing like a cake.</p>
