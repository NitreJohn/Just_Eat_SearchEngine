<title>Poffertjes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Poffertjes</h1>
<p><b>Poffertjes</b>
 (Dutch pronunciation:[ˈpɔfərcəs]&#160;(listen)) are a traditional Dutchbatter treat. Resembling small, fluffy pancakes, they are made with yeast and buckwheat flour. Unlike American pancakes, they have a light, spongy texture. Typically, <i>poffertjes</i>
 are served with powdered sugar and butter, and sometimes syrup or advocaat.</p>
<p>Mainly in the summer season, temporary stands selling <i>poffertjes</i>
 are quite popular, and sell portions containing one or two dozen of them. Usually the cook prepares them freshly for the customer. They are sold on a small cardboard (sometimes plastic) plate and come with a small disposable fork the size of a pastry fork. <i>Poffertjes</i>
 are not difficult to prepare, but a special cast iron pan or copper pan (also available in aluminium with Teflon coating) with several shallow indentations in the bottom is required.</p>
<p>Almost all Dutch supermarkets (like Albert Heijn and Dirk, C1000, Lidl &amp; Jumbo) sell ready-made poffertjes that only need to be microwaved, and are sold complete with a sachet of powdered sugar and a small serving of butter. Supermarkets also stock mixes for poffertjes, to which only eggs and milk need to be added. Usually they contain some kind of leavening agent like baking powder.</p>
<p>They can also be served with other sweet garnishes, such as syrup, whipped cream or strawberries, for added flavor.</p>
<p><i>Poffertjes</i>
 are also known in Indonesian cuisine through its historical ties as the former Dutch colony. <i>Poffertjes</i>
 are thought to be related to and to have influenced the Indonesian <i>kue cubit</i>
.</p>
