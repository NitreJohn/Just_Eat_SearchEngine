<h1>Funing big cake</h1>
<p><b>Funing big cake</b>
 (Chinese: 阜宁大糕; pinyin: <i>fù níng dà gāo</i>
) is a type of cake found in Funing County in the Jiangsu province of China.[1] It can be served as a tea cake or it can be fried.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Funing big cake can be dated to 2,000 years ago. It has another name, which is jade belt cake. As to the issue why is it also called so, there are two different stories. One version is that this name is given by the Qianlong Emperor. After eating one slice, the emperor spoke highly of it and gave it this name. However, another version also spread widely. Many years ago, local officials take it as a tribute delivering into the palace. Someone was promoted due to this and got a jade belt as an award. As a result, its name of jade belt cake became widely used.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Its raw materials are traditionally sticky rice,[1]white sugar[1] and refined lard.[2] Due to health concerns associated with lard consumption, sometimes vegetable oil is used instead of lard.[2] Sometimes the cake also contains pine nuts, semen juglandis (walnuts), or other ingredients as burdenings (garnishes?).</p>
