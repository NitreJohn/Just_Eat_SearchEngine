<h1>Dutch letter</h1>
<p>The <b>Dutch letter</b>
 (also referred to as <b>banket letter</b>
,[1]<b>almond letter</b>
, <b>butter letter</b>
,[2] and in Dutch as <b>banketstaven<i></b>
</i>
 and <b>letterbanket<i></b>
</i>
) is a type of pastry or cookie that is typically prepared using a mixture of flour, eggs and butter or puff pastry as its base and filled with almond paste, dusted with sugar and shaped in an "S" or other letter shape.[1][3][4][5]Marzipan, an almond paste prepared with almond meal and honey or sugar, is sometimes used as the filling.[6] The Dutch letter has a porous or airy and flaky texture.[7]</p>
<p>The pastry was originally shaped "into the initial of the family's surname."[4] Nowadays, the most common shape of the food in the United States is as the letter "S".[4][5] Dutch letters are served as a treat during December, and particularly on <i>Sinterklaasavond</i>
 on December 5 in the Netherlands,[8] and during some festivals in the United States.</p>
