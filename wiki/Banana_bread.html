<title>Banana bread - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Banana bread</h1>
<p><b>Banana bread</b>
 is a type of bread that is made with mashed fully ripe bananas.[1] It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however, there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style yeast breads.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Banana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s. It appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 <i>Balanced Recipes</i>
 cookbook,[2] and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original <i>Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book</i>
 in 1950.[3]</p>
<p>National Banana Bread day is 23 February.[4] Bananas appeared in the US in the 1870s and it took a while for them to appear as ingredient items for desserts.[<i>citation needed</i>
] The modern banana bread recipe began being published in cookbooks around the 1930s and its popularity was greatly helped by the introduction of baking powder on the market. Some food historians believe banana bread was a byproduct of the Great Depression as resourceful housewives did not wish to throw away overripe bananas (as they were still a costly item to purchase), others believe the modern banana bread was developed in corporate kitchens to promote flour and baking soda products.[5]</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Banana bread without nuts</p>
<p>Banana bread (loaf) and mint chocolatemuffin (Philippines)</p>
