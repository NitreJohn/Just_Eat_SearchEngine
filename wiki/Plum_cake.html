<title>Plum cake - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Plum cake</h1>
<p><b>Plum cake</b>
 has historically referred to an early type and style of fruitcake in England since around 1700.[1]Raisins and currants were used, which the English referred to as plums since around 1660.[1] Plum cakes during this period were raised by whipping air into the cake batter, rather than by the use of yeast.[1] In Great Britain, the term plum cake still typically refers to what most Americans refer to as a type of fruitcake, and the term plum originally referred to prunes, raisins or grapes in England.[2][3] In Old English, the term <i>plÅ«me</i>
 was "from medieval Latin pruna, from Latin prunum, which equated to prune.[4]Plum pudding is a similar dish prepared with similar ingredients, cooked by steaming the mixture rather than baking it.[3]</p>
<p>In contemporary times, <b>plum cake</b>
 may also refer to a type of cake prepared using plum as a primary ingredient.[3] In some versions, after cooking, the plums may become jam-like inside of the cake.[5] Some versions may be prepared using plum jam.[6] Plum cake prepared with plums is also a part of Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, and is referred to as <i>pflaumenkuchen</i>
.[7]</p>
<p><b>Prune cake</b>
 is a type of plum cake.[8]</p>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>In the 1881 book <i>Sweet Dishes</i>
, Colonel Henry-Herbert says that "a good English plum cake...is a national institution".[9]</p>
<p>The English version of plum cake also exists on the European mainland, although these may not contain as much fruit and may be drier compared to English versions.[10]</p>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p>Plum cake in the United States originated from English settlers around "the turn of the eighteenth century", and was prepared in the English style.[11] During this time, it was prepared in sizes ranging from small, such as for parties in celebration of Twelfth Night and Christmas, to large, such as for weddings.[11] This original fruitcake version of plum cake in the United States has been referred to as a reigning "standard American celebration cake through the time of the civil war".[1]</p>
<p>During colonial times in the U.S., a virtually identical cake was called election cake, and was prepared with currants, raisins, molasses and spices, with the addition of brandy in the recipe occurring later.[12] Election cakes were typically leavened with yeast. In New England, large election cakes weighing around 12 pounds (5.4&#160;kg) would traditionally be served while people waited for election results.[12] It has been stated that the first published election cake recipe appeared in 1796 in the book <i>American Cookery</i>
, by Amelia Simmons.[12]</p>
<p>Plum cake recipes in the fruitcake style appeared in early cookbooks in the Southern United States, and did not actually call for plums.[13]</p>
<p>After 1830 in the U.S., plum cake was often referred to as fruit cake or black cake.[1]</p>
<p>In 1885, plum cake in the U.S. was described in the book <i>Some noted princes, authors &amp; statesmen of our time</i>
 as a solid, dark-colored, thick cake with copious amounts of plums, gritty notes from raisins, and as "mucilaginous".[14]</p>
<h2>In popular culture</h2>
<p>At times, Thomas Carlyle ate a light style of plum cake while drinking tea, which he would dip into the tea.[14] The cake is described as bun-like with currants "dotted here and there".[14]</p>
