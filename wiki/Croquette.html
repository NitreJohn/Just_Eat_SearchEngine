<title>Croquette - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Croquette</h1>
<p>A <b>croquette</b>
 is a small breadcrumbed fried food roll containing, usually as main ingredients, mashed potatoes and/or ground meat (veal, beef, chicken, or turkey), shellfish, fish, cheese, vegetables, and mixed with béchamel or brown sauce,[1] and soaked white bread, egg, onion, spices and herbs, wine, milk, beer, or any of the combination thereof, sometimes with a filling, e.g. sautéed onions, mushrooms, or boiled eggs (Scotch eggs). The croquette is usually shaped into a cylinder, disk, or oval shape, and then deep-fried. The croquette (from the French <i>croquer</i>
, "to crunch") gained worldwide popularity, both as a delicacy and as a fast food.</p>
<p>Mashed potato-filled croquettes are often served as a side dish in winter holiday meals, such as Christmas. In fast food cuisine, varieties exist without potatoes, but with cheese, beef, or goulash, often in a filling based on béchamel sauce.</p>

<h2>Asia</h2>
<p>A potato-filled croquette called <i>aloo tikki</i>
[2] is very popular in northern India and is typically served with a stew. They are mostly eaten as snacks at home and are also popularly sold by road-side vendors. In West Bengal, it is called <i>alu chop</i>
, as in Bangladesh. Sometimes it is called a "cutlet" and eaten plain or as a fast food variation that is served inside a hamburger bun (like a vegetarian burger). Meat croquettes called <i>kababs</i>
 are made with minced mutton. Lightly spiced beef croquettes are a popular snack and appetiser among the Christian communities in Goa and Kerala.[3]</p>
<p>The <i>kroket</i>
[4] (Dutch) made of potato and minced chicken inside a crepe-like wrapper is one of the more popular snack items in Indonesia, introduced during the Dutch colonial rule. The <i>kroket</i>
 is made by wrapping a potato and chicken filling inside a crepe-like wrapper, breaded, and fried.</p>
<p>A relative of the croquette, known as <i>korokke</i>
[5] ( コロッケ ) is a very popular fried food, widely available in supermarkets and butcher shops, as well as from specialty <i>korokke</i>
 shops. Generally patty-shaped, it is mainly made of potatoes with some other ingredients such as vegetables (e.g. onions and carrots) and maybe less than 5% meat (e.g. pork or beef). It is often served with <i>tonkatsu</i>
 (とんかつ) sauce. Cylinder-shaped <i>korokke</i>
 are also served, which more closely resemble the French version, where seafood (prawns or crab meat) or chicken in white sauce (<i>ragout</i>
) is cooled down to make it harden before the croquette is breaded and deep-fried. When it is served hot, the inside melts. This version is called "cream <i>korokke</i>
" to distinguish it from the potato-based variety. It is often served with no sauce or tomato sauce. Unlike its French cousin, croquettes made mainly of meat are not called <i>korokke</i>
 in Japan. They are called <i>menchi katsu</i>
 (メンチカツ), short for minced meat cutlets.</p>
<p>Usually called <i>goroke</i>
 (고로케) or <i>keuroket</i>
 (크로켓),[6] it is a food sold in most bread shops in Korea. The most common type is deep fried rolls stuffed with <i>japchae</i>
 (잡채) ingredients or chicken curry. Also, <i>goroke</i>
 are sometimes filled with <i>kimchi</i>
, pork, and bulgogi<i> ingredients. Many Korean stores often advertise the</i>
 goroke <i>as a French product and is usually sold in most European-style bread stores all over Korea.</i>
</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>Almost every restaurant offers <i>kroketten/croquettes</i>
 as a side dish, and they always mean the variety filled with mashed potatoes. They are also very commonly eaten at home, and available frozen in every supermarket.</p>
<p>Another common and more typical Belgian variety is filled with grey shrimp - <i>garnaalkroketten/croquettes de crevettes</i>
. These are typically garnished with a slice of lemon and deep-fried parsley. They are usually ordered as an appetiser, occasionally as the main course, but never as a side dish. A less typical but equally common version with cheese - <i>kaaskroketten/croquettes de fromage</i>
 - is usually offered as an alternative.</p>
<p>The ragout-filled dish was regarded as a French cuisine delicacy, first described in a recipe from 1691 by the chef of the French king Louis XIV and using ingredients such as truffles, sweetbreads, and cream cheese.[7] From the 1800s onwards, it became a way to use up leftover stewed meat.</p>
<p>Plain potato croquettes[8] are served as side dish in restaurants and are also available frozen in supermarkets. They are usually called <i>Kroketten</i>
 (singular <i>Krokette</i>
).</p>
<p><i>Krokett</i>
 is a small cylindrical croquette similar to the Czech variety: potatoes, eggs, flour, and butter, seasoned with nutmeg and salt and deep-fried in oil. This variety can be ordered in most restaurants as a side dish, and also bought frozen. When made with cottage cheese, they are called <i>túrókrokett</i>
.[9]</p>
<p>In Italy, <i>crocchette</i>
 (named in the south as <i>crocchè</i>
) are made mainly with crushed potatoes or vegetables, like aubergines (<i>crocchette di melanzane</i>
). They originate from Naples and Sicily, and are served as antipasti in the pizzerie all around Italy.</p>
<p>Plain potato croquettes are available frozen or refrigerated in most supermarkets. They are also homemade, usually with the addition of chopped onion.</p>
<p>After World War II, several suppliers started mass-producing croquettes[10] filled with beef. The croquette subsequently became even more popular as a fast food; meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs which is subsequently deep-fried. Its success as a fast food garnered its reputation as a cheap dish of dubious quality, to such an extent that Dutchtongue in cheekurban myths relate its "allegedly mysterious content" to offal and butchering waste.[11] Research in 2008 showed that 350 million <i>kroketten</i>
 are eaten in the Netherlands every year. An estimated 75% of all Dutch people eat them, resulting in 29 <i>kroketten</i>
 per person per year on average. The major consumers are between 35 and 49 years old.[12]</p>
<p>The success of the croquette led to a whole series of food products resembling the croquette, but with other types of fillings, such as noodles, rice and kidney, and with names like <i>bamibal</i>
, <i>nasibal</i>
, and <i>nierbroodje</i>
 instead of croquette. Variants of the croquette which specify the kind of meat can also be found, like <i>rundvleeskroket</i>
 (made with beef) and <i>kalfsvleeskroket</i>
 (made with veal). Also popular in Dutch snack bars is the <i>satékroket</i>
 where the filling consists of a peanut satay sauce and shredded meat in a ragout. A smaller round version of the standard beef or veal croquette, the <i>bitterbal</i>
,[10] is often served with mustard as a snack in bars and at receptions. Potato croquettes and potato balls (similar to potato croquettes, but small and round) can be bought frozen in most food stores.</p>
<p><i>Broodje kroket</i>
, a croquette on a bread roll, is sold in restaurants, snack shops, and even by street vendors. The popularity of the <i>kroket</i>
 in the Netherlands is such that even McDonald's sells their version on a bun as "McKroket".[13]</p>
<p>Croquettes in Poland[14] are basically made from a thin, rolled pancake stuffed with mushrooms, meat, cabbage, sauerkraut, or combinations of those ingredients, then covered in breadcrumbs, fried in a pan, and usually served with a clear soup like borscht.</p>
<p><i>Croquetes</i>
[15] are cylindrical, covered in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried. They are usually made with white sauce and beef, sometimes mixed with varying amounts of pork, and frequently with some <i>chouriço</i>
, black pepper or <i>piri-piri</i>
 to add more flavour. Seafood, fish (other than codfish) and vegetarian (potato) croquetes are also eaten in Portugal, but those have other names (such as <i>rissol, pastel, empada</i>
), thus the name croquete only refers to the Dutch-style beef <i>croquette</i>
.</p>
<p>The widespread котлета рубленная[16] (from French <i>cotelette</i>
) is made of minced meat (beef or pork or mixture of both, chicken, turkey, or fish), bread, eggs, white onions, salt and spices, shaped as a meat patty and pan fried. Bread is added in amount up to 25% of meat, adding softness to the final product and also making it cheaper to produce. Another popular variation similar to French <i>cotelettes de volaille</i>
 is chicken Kiev, made from boned chicken breast pounded and rolled around cold unsalted butter, then breaded and fried.</p>
<p>Traditional <i>croquetas</i>
,[17] in Spain are usually made with béchamel, and only in some cases with mashed potatoes. They are typical <i>tapas</i>
 dishes, especially filled with <i>jamón</i>
, chicken or cod. While in the two latter béchamel is usually employed, potatoes are more common in cod croquettes. Unfilled bechamel croquettes are also consumed in parts of Spain. Also, many bars and restaurants may offer novel, less traditional versions of croquettes with more varied fillings and ingredients such as mushrooms, <i>morcilla</i>
 (blood sausage), cheeses, cuttlefish (including its ink), etc.</p>
<p>Croquettes[18] are available frozen[19] or refrigerated in most supermarkets, typically with potato filling.</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<p>Croquettes are usually made of tuna or chicken[20][21] and potatoes. In southern Mexico, a variety is made with fresh cheese, plantain, and black beans.</p>
<p>"Boardwalk" fish cakes and crab cakes, eaten on the east coast of the United States, are essentially croquettes. They consist, respectively, of chopped fish or crab meat, mixed in a buttery dough which is then breaded and deep-fried.</p>
<p>A deviled crab (<i>croqueta de jaiba</i>
) is a particular variety of a blue crab croquette from Tampa, Florida. The crab meat is seasoned with a unique Cuban-style enchilada or <i>sofrito</i>
 sauce (locally known as <i>chilau</i>
[22]), breaded with stale Cuban bread crumbs, formed into the approximate shape of a prolate spheroid, and fried. It is meant to be eaten with one hand. It originated in the immigrant community of Ybor City during a cigar workers' strike in the 1920s[23][24][25] and is still very popular in the area.</p>
<p>Other types of crab and fish croquettes are made throughout the southern U.S., especially in coastal states such as Louisiana where seafood dishes are common staples. These varieties have different seasonings and shapes, with some served inside the scooped-out shell of the crab.</p>
<p>A traditional New England/Northeastern United States preparation uses ham, usually of the maple-cured variety, along with cooked mashed potato (often mixed with some mild seasonings and milk or butter for a smoother consistency) for the outer roll. These are dipped in crumbed breading, and sautéed or fried in a small skillet using butter. Typically, these are most common during the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas holiday season as one of several ways to use up leftover holiday ham.</p>
<p>Another croquette dish popular across much of the American South is salmon croquettes. Any canned fish - usually salmon or mackerel, although canned tuna is also used in some recipes (although the dish is often colloquially referred to as "salmon croquettes" or "salmon patties" regardless of the actual fish used) - is mashed by hand to break up any fish bones and give the fish meat a smoother consistency, then combined with a binder and various seasonings. Seasonings typically include pepper, salt, chopped (sometimes sautéed) onions, garlic, lemon juice, and/or paprika. The binder can be any starch such as flour, cornmeal, matzo meal, ground crackers of any type, even white rice or oatmeal - although these latter variations are not as common, and are mostly limited to the northern U.S. Chopped eggs, parsley, and Parmesan cheese may also be added. The mixture is then shaped into rounded patties for pan- or deep-frying; corn or peanut oil are the most commonly used frying oils in the southern U.S., but canola, safflower, or olive oil are also used, and some recipes call specifically for pan-frying in butter or margarine.</p>
<h2>South America</h2>
<p>Croquettes,[26] primarily made from beef, are common in many parts of Brazil. The <i>coxinha</i>
 is a popular chicken-based croquette, intentionally shaped to look like a chicken thigh.</p>
<p>From Riobamba lapingachos are potato cakes with a cheese filling, fried in oil with achote and served with a peanut sauce.</p>
