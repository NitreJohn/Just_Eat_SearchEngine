<title>Gansito - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Gansito</h1>
<p><b>Gansito</b>
 (Spanish "little goose"), is a Mexican snack cake, which some people think taste similar to Twinkies, with the exception of strawberry jelly along with the creamy filling and that it is covered in chocolate with chocolate sprinkle topping. It was created in 1957 by Marinela (the pastries division of the breadmaking Bimbo brand). Gansito is one of the first three products to emerge from this brand. This specific snack cake is heavily marketed, possibly more than any other of Bimbo's products which include white and wheat bread, cereal bars, pound cakes and several other cakes, various pastries, cookies, and wafers.</p>
<p>The 1.8 oz packs 200 calories, 8 grams of fat of which 8 grams are saturated fat, and less than 9 percent of any vitamin, though it is marketed as being vitamin enriched.</p>
<p>The Gansitos are sold all over Mexico.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Trademark</h2>
<p>In a study,[1] the Gansito name brand and "cute-looking goose" was remembered by 92% of a children's study group, whereas only 19% can recall the most basic Mexican history dates. This case of heavy publicity is also seen in the company's website (Marinela.com.mx).</p>
<p>The appearance of the "little goose" mascot has changed dramatically over its 50 years, from a university graduate goose, to a goose dressed in winter clothing, to a childish-looking goose, a teenager goose with jeans, t-shirt and spiky hair and now, a gosling.</p>
<p>The mascots on the website speak English or Spanish with roughly translated tag-lines or slogans.</p>
<h2>Other Latin American countries</h2>
<p>There is also a very similar snack cake in Colombia, with the same name, manufactured by Ramo. However, unlike the Mexican version, the "little goose" mascot has not changed over the years. Mexican Gansito is sold under the name <i>Pipiolo</i>
 to distinguish the two.</p>
<p>Peru had their own version of <i>Gansito</i>
 as well. The 1980s version of Gansito featured a goose in a sailor suit with a beret. As a result of the 1990s de-regulation of foreign capital, Bimbo/Marinela acquired the Peruvian company PYC and re-badged the product with the Mexican style.</p>
