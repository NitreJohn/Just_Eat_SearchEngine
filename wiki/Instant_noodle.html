<title>Instant noodle - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Instant noodle</h1>
<p><b>Instant noodles</b>
 are a precooked and usually dried noodle block, sold with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil, usually in a separate packet; though in the case of cup noodles the flavoring is often loose in the cup. Dried noodle blocks are cooked or soaked in boiling water; some instant noodle products are seal packed—these can be reheated or eaten straight from the packet. Instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando (born Go Pek-Hok) of Nissin Foods in Japan.[1] They were launched in 1958 under the brand name Chikin Ramen. In 1971, Nissin introduced Cup Noodles, a dried noodle block in a polystyrene cup.</p>
<p>The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, though air-dried noodle blocks are favoured in Western countries. The main ingredients used in dried noodles are wheat flour, palm oil, and salt. Common ingredients in the flavoring powder are salt, monosodium glutamate, seasoning, and sugar. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under several brand names.</p>
<p>Ramen, a Japanese noodle soup, sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers (as Indomie use Mie goreng as a descriptor for their Mi goreng range), has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.[2]</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Instant noodles were invented by Taiwanese-Japanese inventor Momofuku Ando in Japan. It was first marketed on 25 August 1958, by Ando's company, Nissin, under the brand name Chikin Ramen.[3] Ando developed the production method of flash frying noodles after they had been made, creating the "instant" noodle. This dried the noodles and gave them a longer shelf life, even exceeding that of frozen noodles. Each noodle block was pre-seasoned and sold for 35 yen. Initially, due to its price and novelty, Chikin Ramen was considered a luxury item, as Japanese grocery stores typically sold fresh noodles for one-sixth their price.[4][5] Despite this, instant noodles eventually gained immense popularity, especially after being promoted by Mitsubishi Corporation.[6]</p>
<p>In 1971, Nissin introduced Nissin Cup Noodles, instant noodles in a polystyrene cup, to which boiling water is added to cook the noodles. A further innovation added dried vegetables to the cup, creating a complete instant soup dish.</p>
<p>According to a Japanese poll in the year 2000, "the Japanese believe that their best invention of the twentieth century was instant noodles."[7] As of 2010[update], approximately 95 billion servings of instant noodles are eaten worldwide every year. China consumes 42 billion packages of instant noodles per year&#160;– 44% of world consumption&#160;– Indonesia, 14 billion; Japan, 5.3 billion, Vietnam 4.8 billion, USA 4 billion. Per capita, South Koreans consume the greatest amount of instant noodles, 69 per capita per year.[8]</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>The main ingredients in instant noodles are flour, starch, water, salt and/or a salt substitute known as <i>kansui</i>
, a type of alkaline mineral water containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid. Originally, <i>kansui</i>
 was named after the water from Inner Mongolia's Lake Kan which contained large amounts of these minerals and was said to be perfect for making the ramen on which instant noodles are based.</p>
<p>Specific types of noodle can be made from a mix of wheat flour and other flour such as buckwheat. There are variations to the ingredients used depending on the country of origin in terms of the salt content and the flour content.</p>
<p>The noodle production starts with dissolving of the salt, starch, and flavoring in water to form a mixture which is then added to the flour. The dough is then left for a period of time to mature, then for even distribution of the ingredients and hydration of the particles in the dough, it is kneaded. After it is kneaded, the dough gets made into two sheets compounded into one single noodle belt by being put through two rotating rollers. This process is repeated to develop gluten more easily as the sheet is folded and passed through the rollers several times. This will create the stringy and chewy texture found in instant noodles. When the noodle belt is made to the desired thickness by adjusting the gap in the rolls, it is then cut right away. Wavy noodles are made in a slow paced conveyor belt and are hindered by metal weights when coming out of the slitter which gives the noodle its wavy appearance. If the strands are to be molded into other shapes, liquid seasoning could be added as well. Once the noodles are shaped, it is ready to be steamed for 1–5 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius to improve its texture by gelatinizing the starch of the noodles.</p>
<p>Next, noodles can be dried in one of two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1–2 minutes at a temperature of 140–160 degrees Celsius. The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30–50% to 2–5%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of canola, cottonseed and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm olein are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30–40 minutes in hot air at a temperature of 70–90 degrees Celsius, resulting in a moisture content of 8–12%. The heat from either drying process will further add to the porous texture of the noodles by gelatinizing the starch even more. More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15–20% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.</p>
<p>Before packaging with seasoning, the noodles are cooled after drying, and its quality of moisture, color, and shape are checked. Packaging of the noodles include films impermeable to air and water. There are two forms of packaged instant noodles, one in a bag with the provided seasoning in small sachets inside, or in a cup with seasoning on the top of the noodles. There are a variety of flavors to the noodles depending on which ones are added to the seasoning. Such flavors include beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, oriental, etc. In instant noodle cups, soy protein and dehydrated vegetables and meats are often added for further flavor.</p>
<p>The shelf life of instant noodles ranges from 4–12 months, depending on environmental factors. Their stability comes from the high sodium content with low moisture, and low water activity. Instant noodles can be served after 1–2 minutes in boiled water or soaked in hot water for 3–4 minutes.[9]</p>
<h2>Health and safety concerns</h2>
<p>Instant noodles are often criticized as unhealthy or junk food.[10] A single serving of instant noodles is high in carbohydrates and fat, but low in protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals.[11][12] The addition of fresh chopped vegetables and/or healthy lean meat, fish or egg to the finished noodle soup, however, can add some nutritional value.[13]</p>
<p>Another concern is that if served in an instant broth, instant noodles typically contain high amounts of sodium. The current U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance of sodium for adults and children over 4 years old is 1,500&#160;mg/day. Typical cup-type instant noodles contain 2,700&#160;mg of sodium (per 100 g of edible portions).</p>
<p>However, recent studies by the CDC and the National Academies Institute of Medicine call into question this assumption.[14] The CDC found that while Americans still consume too much salt, it is "no longer a significant health hazard", and that reducing salt below the recommended level could be hazardous to your health. The National Academies Institute of Medicine performed a 5-year study on nearly 29,000 participants, finding "no relationship between salt and a person's health", saying that consuming up to between 1 and 3 TSP has no adverse effects to health.[15] However, the study recognizes that further study on Sodium levels below 1 TSP would be necessary to conclude if levels below 1 TSP would reduce cardiovascular problems, but "The evidence on health outcomes is not consistent with efforts that encourage lowering of dietary sodium in the general population to 1,500 mg/day."[16]</p>
<p>Another concern regarding the consumption of fried foods, including instant noodles, is the possible presence of oxidation products, including acrylamides and aldehydes resulting from poor maintenance of the oil. If the cooking oil is not maintained at the proper temperature or changed as often as necessary (see gutter oil), these oxidation products accumulate toxins and are present in the foods.[17][18][19] Proper production standards are defined and promoted by World Instant Noodles Association to mitigate these risks after incidents of instant noodle contamination in developing Asia.</p>
<p>Lead contamination in Nestlé's Maggi brand instant noodles made headlines in India, some 7 times the allowed limit, with several Indian states banning the product as well as Nepal.[20] On June 5, 2015, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) orders banned all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles from India, terming them <b>"unsafe and hazardous" for human consumption</b>
.[21]</p>
<h2>Worldwide</h2>
<p>Instant noodle is a popular food in many parts of the world, undergoing changes in flavor to fit local tastes.</p>
<p>In Argentina instant noodles are gaining popularity and can be found in most major cities in supermarkets. The brand is usually Sapporo Ichiban. The Maruchan brand can also be found at Disco and Coto supermarkets. Due to the recent Chinese immigration wave, specialized Chinese supermarkets offer a wide variety of instant noodle brands.</p>
<p>The most popular manufacturer of instant noodle in Australia is San Remo Macaroni Company, whose Fantastic and Suimin brands hold a 30% market share.[22] Other brands include Indomie, Indomie Mi Goreng (fried Indonesian noodles served with or without broth), Maggi Noodles, Nissin's Demae Ramen, and Nongshim's Shin ramyun served with broth. Instant noodles are often referred to as "two-minute noodles" in Australia, a reflection of their preparation time.</p>
<p>Maggi is the most popular brand of instant noodle in Bangladesh. Instant noodle is popular as snacks. They are often combined with eggs and seasonal vegetables.[<i>citation needed</i>
]</p>
<p>For a long time, the main manufacturer of instant noodle was Nissin Miojo, to the extent that, in Brazil, the most common name for them is "Miojo", although the manufacturers call them "lámen" or "l'amen". Many other companies, such as Maggi and Nestlé, also offer this product. There are many variants, such as "Lámen Cremoso", which has a creamy sauce, and "Lámen Hot", which includes pepper, as well as yakisoba and spaghetti.</p>
<p>Instant noodles were first introduced into Canada at least as early as 1974, with Ramen noodles as its Japanese originator. There are many brands available, including major brands from companies such as Nissin Foods, Sapporo Ichiban, Mr. Noodles, Nong Shim, and Knorr. In some areas, these noodles are referred to simply by their brand names, though they are predominantly referred to as "instant noodles". These brand-name packages generally only contain one flavoring pouch. Some brands, mostly more expensive Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai brands, include more flavoring and separate packets for dried vegetables, flavoring contained in oil, and pepper, in addition to the soup stock. Korean brands such as Nong Shim are readily available in most large grocery stores, and in some major cities, brands imported from Europe are also available.</p>
<p>In larger grocery stores and Asian markets in larger cities, a large variety of brands and international flavors can be found, including noodles from such places as Thailand, Indonesia, and India. Instant noodles from Grace, a Caribbean food company, are available in some places. Due to the large South Asian population in some major cities, Maggi is also a popular brand. Product formats include regular plastic wrapping and in various foam food containers.</p>
<p>The market is focusing on higher-end products, generally costing more than 1 RMB. The top three brands in this category dominate more than 85% of the market; for the lower end, those costing less than 1 RMB, the leading five brands hold about 60% of the market share. The dominant brands in the Chinese market are:</p>
<p>In Q3 2014, instant noodles sales declined by 9.1 percent year-on-year, due to some of lower-income migrant workers shifted to more quality instant noodles from Korea, while Chinese instant noodle companies lured the consumers with more cheaper instant noodles. 40 billion packets of instant noodles sold annually in China with about half portion of world's consume a year. In year 2010, only 10 percent of instant noodle companies are still exist, compare to a decade ago.[23]</p>
<p>Virtually all supermarkets sell instant noodles of some sort, but they tend to be Westernized and come in foam containers, costing upwards of 5 kroner. Ethnic stores and specialty shops offer the most popular alternative, Yum Yum, whose prices range from 3–4 kroner; "3 for 10" offers are nearly universal. Its popularity has been sufficient to become a generic brand name. Mama, another brand from Thailand, is the second most popular Eastern brand but has a much smaller market share. Wai Wai, a brand from Nepal, is also available. Most Danish supermarket instant noodles contain MSG as a flavor enhancer.</p>
<p>Instant soups have a long tradition in Germany, back to the 19th century, with, for example, the inventions of Justus von Liebig, or Maggi products. Instant noodles as discussed here, however, were relatively unknown in Germany until the 1990s, but they have since continually gained in popularity.</p>
<p>There are two types of ramen in Germany: the first, generally called "Instant-Nudeln" (instant noodles), tends to be a mild, Westernized version and comes in flavors such as chicken, vegetable, beef and button mushroom. The second type is called "Ramen" and is quite similar to traditional ramen as it is known in Asia. German "Ramen" was originally considered an ethnic food and was only available in specialty stores. Since the mid-1990s, it has become available at German supermarkets. The most popular brands are <i>Yum Yum</i>
, Thai Chef, NissinCup Noodles, and Maggi.</p>
<p>Cantonese people have a long history of cooking yi mein, a noodle invented in the Qing Dynasty. Modern instant noodles were publicly introduced as "Doll Noodles" in the late 1960s by Winner Food Products Ltd, which was bought by Nissin in 1984. That term has since become a synonym for instant noodles irrespective of brands in Hong Kong and it is usually taken as a derogatory term for poor, busy and/or unhealthy lifestyle but these noodles have become a part of daily life in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Most supermarkets offer a vast range of choices, including brands from many different countries. Common brands include Shin Ramyun of South Korea, Nissin and Demae Itcho of Japan, Sau Tao of Hong Kong, Indomie of Indonesia, Koka of Singapore and Mama of Thailand. Besides instant wheat noodles, supermarkets also sell instant rice noodles and Cantonese egg noodles. Premium instant noodles can also be found. Some of them are priced at more than HK$20 a pack.</p>
<p>Some noodles are also marketed as a snack which need not to be cooked; consumers ingest the noodles directly out of the packaging similar to crisps. The most common brand for this is Fuku and Baby Star.</p>
<p>The most popular brand in India is Nestlé's Maggi which is promoted as a "two-minute noodle". On June 5, 2015, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles from India, terming them <b>"unsafe and hazardous" for human consumption</b>
.[24]</p>
<p>Other popular brands include Top Ramen Smoodles and Cup Noodles manufactured by Indo-Nissin Ltd, Ching's Instant Noodles, AA Nutritions's Yummy, and Wai-Wai, owned by the Chaudhary Group from Nepal. Smith &amp; Jones, Ching's secrets, Tai Pai Noodles &amp; NE Time noodles (Maruti quality Foods Products Pvt. Ltd) are also popular new brands of instant noodles in India. Wai Wai is gaining momentum in North Eastern states, Sikkim and west Bengal.</p>
<p>Local flavors such as masala and chicken tikka dominate. The most popular flavor of Top Ramen is known as "Curry Smoodles"; its flavorings mimic a basic curry, including onion, garlic, coriander, and a curry masala. A package sells for 10–12 rupees in India. In India, there is also great demand for unflavored instant noodles; brands such as Bambino and Ching's dominate the market.</p>
<p>Ching's and Smith and Jones are brand of Capital Foods Ltd., (Masala, Curry, Chicken Masala under Smith and Jones brand and Ching's Flavor are Manchurian, Schezwan, Hot Garlic and Chicken Roast Garlic).</p>
<p>ITC launched its Yippee noodle under Sunfeast Brand.</p>
<p>Because of increasing health consciousness, Nestle introduced an instant noodle based on whole wheat grain flour, called Atta Noodles. Instant rice noodles are also available in various flavors. However, Nestle's original "Maggi" masala flavored noodles continue to be the most successful brand of instant noodles not only in India but in the United States for Indian Americans, as well. Nestle also has a '2-minute cup noodles' type of maggi known as 'cuppamania', which involves pouring hot water into the prepackaged cup and leaving it to soak and cook.</p>
<p>Foodles, a new instant noodle brand was launched in late 2010, focusing on health issues, with the tagline, ' Noodles without the No '. This range has significantly higher nutrition values compared to other popular brands.[<i>citation needed</i>
] It comes in both Multigrain and Wheat-only forms. The brand is owned by Horlicks.</p>
<p>With production peaking at 14.5 billion packs in 2011, Indonesia is the second largest producer of instant noodle after China which produces 42.5 billion packs a year.[25] An early instant noodle in Indonesia was "Supermi", introduced in the 1970s by Indofood Sukses Makmur, the largest instant noodle producer in the world. It later introduced two additional brands&#160;– "Indomie" and "Sarimi".</p>
<p>Currently, Indofood Sukses Makmur has a market share of about 70% of Indonesian instant noodle production. In 1999, the figure was about 90%; their market share declined following the introduction of "Mie Sedaap" by Wings Food in 2003.</p>
<p>Indonesians prefer noodles with a strong flavor. Popular flavors of Indonesian instant noodle include Chicken curry, Onion and Chicken, Bakso (beef meatball), Mie Goreng and Chicken Soto, a traditional Indonesian chicken soup. In the past, Indomie tried to produce 30 different flavors to reflect various traditional dishes of Indonesian cuisine, but the product line was discontinued after disappointing results with only several popular variants remain in production. Strong local preferences contribute to the low volume of sales of Japanese and other foreign instant noodles in Indonesia; hot and spicy Korean noodles appeal most to these tastes and have the largest market share among foreign instant noodles.</p>
<p>Most of the market share is owned by the product Indomie Mi goreng, A dry instant noodle meant to replicate the traditional Indonesian dish Mie goreng, or fried noodles. Other variants of popular instant noodles in Indonesia includes Mie Gelas, which is sized so it could be served in a drinking glass, and Pop Mie, which is similar to Cup Noodles.</p>
<p>Japan is the country of origin of instant noodles. Instant noodles remain a "national" light food. The average Japanese person eats 40 packs of instant noodles per year.[8]</p>
<p>After their invention by Momofuku Andō in 1958, instant noodles became very common in Japan. In the 1970s, makers expanded their flavors to include such examples as <i>shio</i>
 (salt ramen), <i>miso</i>
, or curry. Beginning in the 1980s, makers also added dried toppings such as shrimp, pork, or eggs. Today, instant noodles are divided into two groups: "traditional" cheap (¥150 to ¥200) noodles with few toppings and expensive (¥200 to ¥500) noodles with many toppings, which are often packed into a pouch. Various kinds of instant noodles are produced, including ramen, udon, soba, yakisoba, and pasta.</p>
<p>Major makers in Japan are:</p>
<p>In Korea, instant noodles were first produced by Samyang Food in 1963 under technical assistance from Myojo Foods Co., Japan which provided manufacturing equipment.[26][27][28] Its quick and easy preparation and cheap price made it quickly popular. In South Korea, instant noodles are more common than non-instant noodles; the word <i>ramyeon</i>
 (Korean: 라면), generally means the instant kind. Most South Korean food stalls make instant ramyeon and add toppings for their customers.</p>
<p>Ramyeon is typically spicy. Shin Ramyun (신[辛], literally "spicy") is the best-selling brand in Korea.[29] It has also become popular in China and the United States. The leading manufacturer of ramyeon in Korea is the Nong Shim ([農心], literally "Farmer Heart") company, which exports many of its products overseas.</p>
<p>In 2004, over 600,000 boxes of Shin brand Ramyeon were sent to North Korea as part of the aid relief program when Ryongchŏn train station exploded, injuring many North Korean civilians. However, insider sources state that most of it was sold in North Korean black markets, making its way to Pyongyang, instead of distributed as aid. North Korean visitors to China also frequently purchase South Korean ramyeon from Chinese stores, where Shin Ramyeon is known as "Korean Tangmi Ramyeon".</p>
<p>Indigenous production of Ramyeon in North Korea began in 2000. The first Ramyeon brand was "kkoburang guksu", which literally means curly noodles in Korean. Later, a joint venture by North Korean and Hong Kong-based companies began producing "jŭksŏk guksu" (Korean: 즉석 국수), which literally means "instant noodles". Ramyŏn are popular among North Korean elites who live in Pyongyang and Nampo. In contrast to hot and spicy South Korean Ramyeon, North Korean Ramyŏn has a much milder and brothier flavor.[30]</p>
<p>Maggi has practically become synonymous with instant noodles. Popular flavors include curry, chicken, tom yum, and asam laksa. Both soup-based and dry variants are readily available. Indomie, Nissin, Cintan and Mamee brands of instant noodles are also well loved by both Malaysians, Singaporeans and Bruneians.</p>
<p>Though instant noodles are usually eaten at home, they are also becoming increasingly popular as restaurant or cafe meals, especially in Hong Kong-themed "cha chan teng" cafes and "Mamak" food shops. These meals are usually modified according to the chef's taste and include minimal monosodium glutamate.</p>
<p>In recent years, instant noodles manufacturers have tried to introduce low-MSG seasonings, as well as new processes that do not require frying for the noodles, and have introduced new flavors such as chilli crab and seafood.</p>
<p>The Apollo (brand name) noodle is very popular in Mauritius. Popular flavors include shrimp, curry, chicken and vegetable. This Mauritian brand is today also widely available in some Western markets like France.</p>
<p>Instant noodles are very popular in Mexico, where they are often viewed as a snack-grade food. Flavors such as lime and chili are popular, often combined with shrimp. It is available in every grocery store and convenience store through all the country. This kind of soup was introduced in the 1980s by the Maggi Corporation as "Instant Maggi Ramen", marketed in a small plastic bag with artificial flavors, but it did not become popular until cup noodles were introduced in 1990 by Maruchan. Due to this popularity, the instant noodles are often referred to simply as "Maruchan". Today, many local brands such as "La Moderna" and "Herdez" have developed their own cup noodles, along Nissin, which is also a newcomer. In the early 2000s, Maggi introduced four instant noodles flavors, like tomato pasta or chicken with green tomatoes, but they were soon discontinued.</p>
<p>Instant noodles are famous in Nepal. In the early 1980s, Gandaki Noodles (P.) Ltd.[31] of Pokhara city, introduced Rara, a white instant noodles named after the largest lake of Nepal. It was a fair success among urban population. Then in around 1985, Chaudhary Groups(CG)[32] entered the market with Wai Wai. Wai-Wai noodles, a brown, spicy and precooked noodle, became a big hit among the people.[33] Over the years, its popularity has grown heavily and consist of a major part of the dry foods sold in Nepal and are available in any part of the country. The Quality control office of Nepal withheld Nepal quality marks for wai wai in 2012.[34]</p>
<p>The Netherlands is home to a large Indonesian community, the largest minority group in the country, which has generated Indonesian supermarkets known as Toko. Various brands of instant noodle are sold through both these outlets and non-specialty supermarkets, including Saimin, Indomie Mi Goreng, Maggi, Thai varieties such as Mama and Yum Yum, and some more western alternatives, such as Conimex and Good Noodles by Unox. Both cup and packet varieties are available.</p>
<p>Since its introduction in 1988, Indomie is the most popular instant noodle brand in Nigeria.[39] Instant noodle brands are now eaten in most households across the country.[40] By 2008, nine other brands of noodle had appeared on the market. Affirming Indomie's hold on the market, Christopher Ezendu, a distributor at the popular Oke-Arin market on Lagos Island, reported that these other brands are aspiring to be like the market leader.[41] In 2013 a wholly owned and managed Nigerian company based in Abuja, Royal Mills and Foods limited, launched a new brand of instant noodle, De-Royal Instant Noodles with two flavors (chicken and onion chicken), in Nigeria.[42]</p>
<p>According to the World Instant Noodle Association, Nigeria was the 13th largest consumer of instant noodle in the world in 2007.[43]</p>
<p>Instant noodle is not a traditional part of Pakistani cuisine, but it showed rapid growth over the review period and became very popular because it is easy to prepare within minutes. Due to the busy lives of urban consumers, they prefer a quick and convenient meal which was provided by noodles. It continued to become popular among children and the younger generation as a mini meal with many flavors such as masala and chicken.[44] There are three challenging brands of instant noodles in Pakistan.[45] Nestlé's Maggi which was the first brand to enter market in 1992, followed by Knorr of Unilever in 1993 and in 2012 Shan Food Industries introduced <i>Shoop</i>
.[46] Knorr is leader with 55% market share and that of Maggi is 45%.[45] Maggi Noodles are available in six flavors: Chicken, Chatkhara, Masala, Lemon Chaska, Karara and Bar-B-Q.[47] In 2011, Knorr launched <i>Soupy Noodles</i>
, along with two other variants, <i>Chicken Delite</i>
 and <i>Mast Masala</i>
. Knorr Noodles have become the brand of choice for kids over the years.[48]</p>
<p>In Peru, Aji-no-men brand ramen had been the only brand sold for a long time. Recently, Maruchan and Nisin ramen became available too, in a wide range of flavors, including beef, chicken, chicken with greens, hen, spicy hen, creole-style hen, shrimp, and oriental-style.</p>
<p>There are many local and imported brands of instant noodle in the Philippines, which are locally known as "instant <i>mami</i>
" (after a Philippine version of chicken noodle soup). Brands available in the Philippines include Lucky Me, Payless, Nissin, QuickChow, Maggi and Ho-Mi. They are sold in packets, sealed paper cups, or sealed foam food containers. Instant noodles are popular as a quick snack or for breakfast because of their fast preparation and affordability.</p>
<p>People sometimes add a fresh egg directly into the instant noodle either in the pot or the bowl. Another popular variation is the instant <i>pancit canton</i>
, stir-fried noodle which is boiled and drained to which a flavoring powder, soy sauce, oil and carrot and celery pieces are added. Popular variations include spicy, soy-sauce-calamansi, and sweet-spicy.</p>
<p>Instant noodles began appearing on Polish store shelves during the early 1990s. Despite being called "Chinese soup", the first brands on the market were produced in Vietnam and had a somewhat spicy, garlic-flavored taste. The noodle packages contained pouches of flavored soup base, spicy oil, dried vegetables or even minuscule shrimps.</p>
<p>The product gained particular popularity among students due to its affordability and convenience. "Kaczka łagodna" (<i>Mild duck</i>
), "Kurczakowa łagodna" (<i>Mild chicken</i>
) and "Krewetkowa ostra" (<i>Spicy shrimp</i>
) were the most common flavors. Today, the local Kim Lan and worldwide Knorr brands offer varieties ranging from cheese-and-herb flavored noodles to local Polish specialties like barszcz czerwony or żurek.</p>
<p>Ngoc Tu Tao, who emigrated to Poland from Vietnam and established the Tan-Viet Group in 1990, is credited with introducing the instant noodle to Poland.

<p>Russia's most popular instant ramen are the local brand <i>Rollton</i>
 and the Korean brand <i>Dosirac</i>
 (Korean for "lunch box"). Instant noodles have been popular in Russia's Far East region since the late 1980s and made their way west in the early 1990s. In Russia, like most noodle products, they are still considered a lesser-quality option to turn to in lean economic times. They are popular among college students and homeless as a regular meal.[50]</p>
<p>Instant noodles have become commonplace in South Africa since the 1990s, when they were first introduced to the general consumer market. While various brands are available, the most common is Maggi 2 Minute Noodles. Because of their low cost, instant noodles are popular in South Africa's poorer communities. They are also popular among students and office workers as a quick snack. In South Africa the term "Ramen" is not used to describe Instant Noodles but rather the traditionally thicker noodles used in authentic Japanese cuisine.</p>
<p>Instant noodles have been widely available in Swedish supermarkets for more than 10 years and are very popular, especially among students.

Cup noodles are usually sold for 10 SEK per package, while packet noodles are usually sold at 4 for 15, 5 for 20 or 6 for 30.</p>
<p>Instant noodle inventor Momofuku Ando was born in Taiwan. According to statistics from the International Ramen Manufacturers Association, Taiwan is the world's 12th largest instant noodle market, with an annual NT$10 billion (US$300 million) in sales. This translates into an annual total of 900 million packs, or 40 per person.[51] Uni-President (aka President or Tong-Yi, 統一) takes the largest market share of instant noodles in the country, and is a major player in the global instant noodle market.</p>
<p>Major makers in Taiwan are:</p>
<p>Instant noodles were imported to Thailand in 1971 from Japan. The first brand was “Sanwa” (now “Nissin”). Afterwards, there are 3 well-known brands producing instant noodles, called “Yum Yum”, “Wai Wai” and “Mama” respectively by Thai companies. The most popular brand of instant noodles in Thailand is "Mama" or dindin cup noodles; Tom Yum Shrimp is the best selling flavor. Thais call instant noodles "Mama". "Mama” is a generic name of instant noodles in Thailand. Other local players in the market include the Wai Wai and Yum Yum brands. Due to their ubiquity, instant noodles were chosen as a vehicle for dietary fortification by a joint effort of the Federation of Thai Industries, instant noodle producers, and the Ministry of Public Health about 10 years ago. The vitamins and minerals added are iron, iodine and vitamin A. Unlike Japanese or Malaysian instant noodles, Mama noodles are often used to cook different dishes using only the noodles, leaving out the seasoning. The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles. Sometimes they will cook the noodles and combine the noodles in a dish called a noodle salad known as "Yum Mama”. This dish is often prepared with meat balls, tomatoes, onion and lettuce. Another method is to stir fry the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs and vegetables to give the noodles an extra flavor. They are sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and has a wide range of flavors. Recently some brands of instant noodles include real dehydrated meat such as pork or beef. The average retail price is between THB 5–6 for regular size and THB 10 for Yum Yum Jumbo packs.</p>
<p>Instant noodles have been quite popular in Ukraine in the past 10 years because they are cheap and save time. Mivina noodles can be cooked as soup or eaten dry; dry instant noodles are as popular in Ukraine as potato chips and croutons. Mivina is rivaled by the Russian Rollton, which also produces instant noodles for quick soups.</p>
<p>A common form of instant noodles in Britain is Pot Noodle, a cup noodle first marketed by Golden Wonder in the late 1970s. These use artificial flavorings and are generally suitable for vegetarians (there is no chicken in Chicken Pot Noodles, for example) and are sold by virtually every major supermarket chain, general groceries shops, and convenience stores. Boiling water is added to the noodles to cook them.</p>
<p>Packet noodles such as Batchelors' Super Noodles are also sold. Several of the larger supermarkets sell eastern brands such as Nissin, Koka noodles and Shin Ramyun, which once could only be found in Asian groceries. Larger retail chains may offer their own brand in basic packaging and a variety of flavors, e.g. Asda, while noodles such as Maggi can also be found in many groceries, but are less widespread.</p>
<p>Unlike in North America, the term <i>ramen</i>
 is not used in this context; <i>ramen</i>
 in the UK would generally only refer to the original Japanese cuisine.</p>
<p>In the United States, instant noodles were first available by Nissin Foods in 1971. In 1972, Nissin Foods introduced "Nissin Cup Noodles" in a foam food cup, which led to an upsurge in popularity. Soon after, many other competing companies were offering similar instant noodle products.</p>
<p>Today, in the U.S., the instant noodle is commonly known as <i>ramen</i>
, after the Japanese dish on which it was originally based, and it comes in a variety of mostly meat-based flavors. The three major brands are Nissin Top Ramen (originally Top Ramen's Oodles of Noodles), Maruchan Ramen, and Sapporo Ichiban. A wide range of popular brands imported from other countries are available at many Asian grocery stores and some supermarkets. Instant ramen noodles are extremely popular among students and other people of low income, due to their ease of preparation and unusually low cost. While price varies throughout the U.S., generally several packages can be purchased for $3 or less.</p>
<p>Instant noodles are popular in Vietnam, where they are often eaten as a breakfast food. Both wheat and rice noodles are common. Acecook Vietnam JSC and VIFON are leading producers of instant noodles.[52] Popular Vietnamese instant noodle soups include Oriental, Bánh đa cua, Bún bò Huế flavored, Phở, and Hủ tiếu Nam Vang, a Phnom Penh-style noodle.</p>
