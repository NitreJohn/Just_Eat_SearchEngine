<title>Polvorón - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Polvorón</h1>
<p>A <b>polvorón</b>
 (From <i>polvo</i>
, the Spanish word for powder, or dust; Cebuano: <b>polboron<i></b>
</i>
; Tagalog: <b>pulburón<i></b>
</i>
) is a type of heavy, soft and very crumbly Spanishshortbread made of flour, sugar, milk, and nuts. They are produced mostly in Andalusia, where there are about 70 factories in that are part of a syndicate that produces polvorones and mantecados.[1] Under the name <i>mantecados</i>
, these sweets are a traditional preparation of other areas of the Iberian Peninsula as well.[2]</p>
<p>Polvorones are popular holiday delicacies in all Spain and its former colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. Traditionally, they were prepared from September to January but are now available all year round. Polvorones were brought to Spain by the Moors and there is thus a very possible Levantine origin, based on a similar sweet known as <i>ghurayba</i>
.[3] As this was introduced by the Arabs, during the Spanish Inquisition, it was later decreed by the officials of the Inquisition that polvorones were to be made using pork fat as a means of detecting secret Jews and Muslims within the Southern Spanish regions.</p>

<h2>Mantecado</h2>
<p><b>Mantecado</b>
 is a name for a variety of Spanish shortbreads that includes the <i>polvorón</i>
. Often both names are synonymous, but not all <i>mantecados</i>
 are <i>polvorones</i>
. The name <i>mantecado</i>
 comes from <i>manteca</i>
, usually the fat of Iberian pig (<i>cerdo iberico</i>
), with which they are made, while the name <i>polvorón</i>
 is based on the fact that these cakes crumble easily into a kind of dust in the hand or the mouth.</p>
<p>In Cuba, <i>mantecado</i>
 is an ice cream and in Spain it may be also the name given to a kind of sweet sherbet.[4] In the Philippines, <i>mantecado</i>
 is a popular and traditional ice cream flavour, characterised as a mixture of vanilla and butter. It was served during the lunchtime banquet that followed the Malolos Congress' ratification on 29 September 1898 of the Philippine Declaration of Independence made in June that year.[5]</p>
<h2>Regional variations</h2>
<p>In Cuba, it is one of the most common flavors of ice cream. Cuba, being the Latin American county in the Caribbean where Spain had the most interest and influence, has adapted the flavors of mantecado or polvorones from Spain into a delicious and beloved flavor for Cuban ice cream. Known worldwide for the delicious flavoring, what some might call a Latin Vanilla, this Cuban flavor has influenced ice cream flavors made in other Latin American places like in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The Filipino version of polvorón uses a large amount of powdered milk which is left dry, as well as toasted flour, and butter or margarine instead of lard. A number of local variants on the traditional <i>polvorón</i>
 recipe have been made. Well-known variants include <i>polvorón</i>
 with <i>kasuy</i>
 (cashew nut), with <i>pinipig</i>
 (pounded and toasted young green rice, similar to crisped rice) and with <i>malunggay</i>
 leaves. Strawberry, chocolate-coated, <i>ube</i>
 (purple yam), peanut, pinipig (crispy rice), and cookies and cream flavoured <i>polvorón</i>
 also exist.</p>
<p>Polvorones are a common Christmas dessert in Spain. These days there are options different from pig fat, like cow fat, as well as vegetarian polvorones and mantecados made with olive oil.</p>
<p>Sometimes called Pan de Polvo, it is made with anise in the south Texas region.</p>
