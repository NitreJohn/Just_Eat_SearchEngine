<title>Sikhye - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Sikhye</h1>
<p><b>Soups &amp; stews</b>
</p>
<p><b>Banchan</b>
</p>
<p><b>Sikhye<i></b>
</i>
 (also spelled <b>shikhye<i></b>
</i>
 or <b>shikeh<i></b>
</i>
; also occasionally termed <b>dansul<i></b>
</i>
 or <b>gamju<i></b>
</i>
) is a traditional sweet Korean rice beverage, usually served as a dessert. In addition to its liquid ingredients, <i>sikhye</i>
 contains grains of cooked rice and in some cases pine nuts.[1]</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Preparations</h2>
<p><i>Sikhye</i>
 is made by pouring malt water onto cooked rice. The malt water steeps in the rice at typically 150 degrees Fahrenheit until grains of rice appear on the surface. The liquid is then carefully poured out, leaving the rougher parts, and boiled until it gets sweet enough (no sugar added to this drink what so ever)</p>
<p>In South Korea and in overseas Korean grocery stores, <i>sikhye</i>
 is readily available in cans or plastic bottles.[1] One of the largest South Korean producers of <i>sikhye</i>
 is the Vilac company of Busan. Atypical of most canned beverages, each can has a residue of cooked rice at the bottom. Homemade <i>sikhye</i>
 is often served after a meal in a Korean restaurant.</p>
<h2>Regional variations</h2>
<p>There are several regional variations of <i>sikhye</i>
. These include Andong<i>sikhye</i>
 and <i>yeonyeop sikhye</i>
 or <i>yeonyeopju</i>
, a variety of <i>sikhye</i>
 made in Gangwon province. Andong <i>sikhye</i>
 differs in that it includes radishes, carrots, and powdered red pepper. Also, it is fermented for several days as opposed to being boiled.[2] The crunchy texture of the radish is kept despite the longer fermentation process; a soft texture would indicate an inferior product. Whereas the sweet canned or restaurant sikhye is enjoyed as a dessert beverage, Andong sikhye is appreciated as a digestive aid, containing lactobacillus.</p>
<h2>Names</h2>
<p><i>Sikhye</i>
 is also referred to by the names <i>dansul</i>
 (단술) and <i>gamju</i>
 (감주; 甘酒). Both of these names mean "sweet wine." However, they are also used to refer to a different, slightly alcoholic rice drink called <i>gamju</i>
.[1]</p>
<p>Pumpkin Sikhye is a water-boiled broth with pumpkin, steamed rice, and malt. It is fermented for several days at a proper temperature. Some sugar is added to taste sweet.</p>
<p>It is original Sikhye in Andong, South Korea. It is a little bit different from other Sikhyes. This Sikhye's color is light red with red pepper added.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Sikhye is believed to aid digestion, it contains dietary fiber and anti-oxidants. It was regularly served to royalty after meals to help digestion.[3]</p>
<p>Sikhye is said to help people who have a "cold" constitution to be warm and also helps those who have too "warm" constitution to be less warm.[3] It is believed to be very helpful for relieving hangovers, too.[3]</p>
