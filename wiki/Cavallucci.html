<title>Cavallucci - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Cavallucci</h1>
<p><b>Cavallucci</b>
 are a rich Italian Christmas pastry made with anise, almonds, candied fruits, coriander, and flour. They are Sienese in origin, and the name translates approximately to "little horses."[1] The chewy biscuits traditionally use Tuscan millefiori honey as an essential ingredient in the paste.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The cookies were originally imprinted with the image of a horse (<i>cavalli</i>
 is the Italian term for horses).[2] The cookies sold today are a gentrified version of a pastry which is traceable to the reign of Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449â€“1492), when they were called <b>biriquocoli</b>
.[3]</p>
<p>Many theories are associated with the origin of its name. According to the most popular version of the story, cavallucci were served to travelers on horseback as a source of nourishment for long trips.[3] Along a similar vein, another story is that postal workers who delivered mail over long distances ate the cookies on a regular basis.[2] Another theory states that these sweets were the usual snack of servants who worked in horse stables of rich Italian aristocrats in Siena, a city which gained its fame for horse racing.[1]</p>
<h2>Serving</h2>
<p>The pastry is often paired with sweet dessert wines, such as Vin Santo, and dipped into the wine before being eaten.[3]</p>
