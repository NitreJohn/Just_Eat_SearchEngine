<title>Turkish delight - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Turkish delight</h1>
<p><b>Turkish delight</b>
 or <b>lokum</b>
 (Turkish: <i>Türk lokumu</i>
) is a family of confections based on a gel of starch and sugar. Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates, pistachios, and hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties are mostly gel, generally flavored with rosewater, mastic, Bergamot orange, or lemon. The confection is often packaged and eaten in small cubes dusted with icing sugar, copra, or powdered cream of tartar, to prevent clinging. Other common flavors include cinnamon and mint. In the production process, soapwort may be used as an emulsifyingadditive.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The exact origin of these sweets is yet to be researched; however Lokum comes from the Arabic Halkum or Al-Halkum. In the Arab World, Turkish delights are called <i>rāḥat al-ḥulqūm</i>
 (رَاحَة الْحُلْقُوم) which means "Throat Comfort". According to the Hacı Bekir company, the sweets as it is known today was developed by Bekir Efendi, named Hacı Bekir after performing the Hajj. He moved to Istanbul from his hometown Kastamonu and opened his confectionery shop in the district of Bahçekapı in 1777.[1][2] The company still operates under the founder's name.[1]</p>
<p>Tim Richardson, a historian of sweets, has questioned the claim of Hacı Bekir to be the creator of Turkish Delight, writing that "specific names and dates are often erroneously associated with the invention of particular sweets, not least for commercial reasons".[3][4]</p>
<p>Ottoman confectionery was originally sweetened with honey and molasses, using water and flour as the binding agents, with rosewater, lemon peel and bitter orange as the most common flavors (red, yellow and green). Hacı Bekir introduced the use of glucose in 1811, shortly after it had been discovered by Gottlieb Kirchhoff.[1]</p>
<p>Lokum was introduced to Western Europe in the 19th century. An unknown Briton reputedly became very fond of the delicacy during his travels to Istanbul and purchased cases of it, to be shipped back to Britain under the name <i>Turkish Delight</i>
. It became a major delicacy in Britain and throughout Continental Europe for high class society. During this time, it became a practice among upper class socialites to exchange pieces of Turkish Delight wrapped in silk handkerchiefs as presents.[5][<i>not in citation given</i>
]</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The Turkish names <i>lokma</i>
 and <i>lokum</i>
 are derived from the Arabic word <i>luqma(t)</i>
 and its plural <i>luqūm</i>
 meaning "morsel" and "mouthful"[6] and the alternative Ottoman Turkish name, <i>rahat-ul hulküm</i>
,[7] was an Arabic formulation, <i>rāḥat al-hulqūm</i>
, meaning "comfort of the throat", which remains the name in formal Arabic.[8] In Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia it is known as <i>ḥalqūm</i>
, while in Kuwait it is called كبده الفرس "chabdat alfaras" and in Egypt it is called <i>malban</i>
 (ملبن&#160; [ˈmælbæn]) or <i>ʕagameyya</i>
 and in Syria<i>rāḥa</i>
. Its name in various Eastern European languages comes from Ottoman Turkish <i>lokum</i>
 or <i>rahat-ul hulküm</i>
. Its name in Greek, λουκούμι (<i>loukoumi</i>
) shares a similar etymology with the modern Turkish. In parts of Cyprus, where the dessert has protected geographical indication (PGI),[9] it is also marketed as <i>Cyprus Delight</i>
.[10] In Armenian it is called lokhum (լոխում). Its name in Bosnian is <i>rahat lokum</i>
, and derives from a very old confusion of the two Ottoman Turkish names found already in Ottoman Turkish;[7] indeed this mixed name can also be found in Turkey today. Its name in Serbo-Croatian is <i>ratluk</i>
, a reduced form of the same name. In Iran's official language, Persian, it is called <i>rāhatol holqum</i>
 (Persian&#160;: راحت الحلقوم).[11]</p>
<p>In English, it was formerly alternatively known as <i>Lumps of Delight</i>
.[12]</p>
<h2>Around the world</h2>
<p>In Greece, Turkish Delight, known as <i>loukoumi</i>
 [λουκούμι] has been a very popular delicacy since the 19th century, famously produced in the city of Patras, Patrina loukoumia, as well as on the island of Syros and the northern Greek cities Serres and Komotini but elsewhere as well. Loukoumi is a common traditional treat, routinely served instead of biscuits along with Turkish coffee. In addition to the common rosewater and bergamot varieties, Mastic-flavored loukoumi is available and very popular.</p>
<p>Another sweet, similar to loukoumi, that is made exclusively in the town of Serres, is Akanés.</p>
<p>In Bulgarian, Turkish Delight, known as lokum (локум) is also very popular and has been in the local culture for a while, presumably it came with the Ottoman Empire, but perhaps earlier, as the Orient has been very influential to the country in terms of cuisine. Bulgaria produces its own brands of lokum.</p>
<p>In Macedonia, Turkish Delight, known as lokum (локум) is popular, as well as in all former Yugoslav countries. One of the biggest chocolate factories "Evropa" is producing Turkish Delight, and people consume it very frequently.</p>
<p>The Romanian word to describe this confection is <i>rahat</i>
, an abbreviation of the Arabic <i>rahat ul-holkum</i>
.[13] However, in the Romanian language, the word <i>rahat</i>
 took a pejorative sense, in this case a euphemism that translates as <i>shit</i>
.[14][15] According to linguist Lazăr Șăineanu, Turkish words which entered the Romanian language in the seventeenth century and eighteenth century became mostly obsolete and acquired a pejorative or ironic sense. Politically and socially, this weakened the influence of Ottoman society, and parts of the Ottoman Turkish language which had not had time to take root in the Romanian language took a touch of irony and became a mine for humorous literature.[16]</p>
<p>Rahat is eaten as is or is added in many Romanian cakes called <i>cornulețe</i>
, <i>cozonac</i>
 or salam de biscuiţi&#160;(fr).[17] Traditionally in Romania and the Balkans, the <i>rahat</i>
 is generally served with coffee.</p>
<p>In 1930 two Armenian immigrants, Armen Tertsagian and Mark Balaban, founded Liberty Orchards of Cashmere, Washington, and began manufacturing "Aplets" (apple and walnut locoum) and "Cotlets" (apricot and walnut locoum). In 1984 they added the medley-flavored "Fruit Delights" line in strawberry, raspberry, orange, blueberry, peach, cranberry, and pineapple assortments. Although all of these confections are marketed under American-style brand names, they are referred to on product packaging as "Rahat Locoum".</p>
<p>Turkish Delight also forms the basic foundation of the Big Turk chocolate bar (distributed by Nestle in Canada).</p>
<p>The confection is known in Brazil as <i>Manjar Turco</i>
, <i>Delícia Turca</i>
, Bala de Goma <i>Síria</i>
 or Bala de Goma <i>Árabe</i>
. As with most Middle Eastern dishes, it came with the Levantine Arab diaspora to Latin America.</p>
<p>Fry's Turkish Delight is marketed by Cadbury in the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa and can also be found in Canada and New Zealand, which is rosewater-flavoured, and covered on all sides in milk chocolate. UK production controversially moved to Poland in 2010.[18]</p>
<h2>Protected geographical indication</h2>
<p>Despite its worldwide popularity and production in several countries, at present, the only protected geographical indication (PGI) for such a product is the name Λουκούμι Γεροσκήπου (Loukoumi Geroskipou) for Turkish delight made in Yeroskipou, Cyprus.[9][19]</p>
<h2>Related products</h2>
<p>Turkish Delight was an early precursor to the jelly bean that inspired its gummy interior.[20][21]</p>
<p>There are "gourmand" perfumes that use Loukoum or Loukhoum in their names and that are said to smell like the confection, as in "Loukhoum"[22] by Ava Luxe, "Lakhoum"[23] by Keiko Mecheri, and "Lakhoum"[24] by Serge Lutens.</p>
