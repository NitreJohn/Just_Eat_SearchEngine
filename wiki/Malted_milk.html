<title>Malted milk - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Malted milk</h1>
<p><b>Malted milk</b>
 is a powdered gruel made from a mixture of maltedbarley, wheat flour, and whole milk, which is evaporated until it forms a powder.</p>
<p>Malt powder comes in two forms: diastatic and nondiastatic. Diastatic malt contains enzymes that break down starch into sugar; this is the form bakers add to breaddough to help the dough rise and create a good crust. Nondiastatic malt has no active enzymes and is used primarily for flavor, mostly in beverages. It sometimes contains sugar, coloring agents, and other additives.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>London pharmacist James Horlick developed ideas for an improved, wheat and malt-based nutritional supplement for infants. Despairing of his opportunities in England, James joined his brother William, who had gone to Racine, Wisconsin, to work at a relative's quarry. In 1873, James and William formed J &amp; W Horlicks to manufacture their brand of infant food in nearby Chicago.[1] Ten years later, they earned a patent[2] for a new formula enhanced with dried milk. The company originally marketed its new product as "Diastoid", but trademarked the name "malted milk" in 1887.[3][4]</p>
<p>Despite its origins as a health food for infants and invalids, malted milk found unexpected markets. Explorers appreciated its lightweight, nonperishable, nourishing qualities, and took malted milk on treks worldwide. William Horlick became a patron of Antarctic exploration, and Admiral Richard E. Byrd named a mountain range in Antarctica after him. Back in the US, people began drinking Horlick's new beverage for enjoyment. James Horlick returned to England to import his American-made product back home and was eventually made a baronet.[1] Malted milk became a standard offering at soda fountains, and found greater popularity when mixed with ice cream in a "malt". "Malt shops" owe their name to the Horlick brothers.[3]</p>
