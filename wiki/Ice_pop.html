<title>Ice pop - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Ice pop</h1>
<p>An <b>ice pop</b>
 is a water-based frozen snack. It is also referred to as a <b>popsicle</b>
 (Canada, U.S.), <b>freeze pop</b>
 (Ireland, U.S.), <b>ice lolly</b>
 (United Kingdom, Ireland), <b>ice block</b>
, <b>icy pole</b>
 (parts of Australia and New Zealand), or <b>chihiro</b>
 (Cayman Islands).[1] It is made by freezing flavored liquid (such as fruit juice) around a stick. Often, the juice is colored artificially.[2] Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. When an ice pop does not have a stick, it is called, among other names, a <b>freezie</b>
.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Frank Epperson of Oakland, California, popularized ice pops after patenting the concept of "frozen ice on a stick" in 1923.[3] He initially called it the Epsicle.[4] A couple of years later, Epperson sold the rights to the invention and the Popsicle brand to the Joe Lowe Company in New York City.[3]</p>
<p>Epperson claimed to have first created an ice pop in 1905 at the age of 11 when he accidentally left a glass of powdered soda and water with a mixing stick in it on his porch during a cold night, a story printed on the back panel of Popscicle brand treat boxes in the 80's and 90's. However, the evidence for this is scant.[3]</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>In the United States and Canada frozen ice on a stick is generically referred to as a <i>popsicle</i>
 due to the early popularity of the Popsicle brand, and the word has become a genericized trademark to mean any ice pop or freezer pop, regardless of brand or format. (The word is a portmanteau of <i>pop</i>
 and <i>icicle</i>
.) They are also called an <i>ice pop</i>
 or <i>freezer pop</i>
 in the United States. In the Caicos Islands it is referred to as an ice saver. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the terms <i>ice lolly</i>
 and <i>ice pop</i>
 are used. <i>Chihiro</i>
 is used as a slang term in the Cayman Islands, partially derived from <i>chill</i>
.[1]<i>Ice block</i>
 or <i>icy pole</i>
 are used in parts of Australia[5] and New Zealand.</p>
<h2>Homemade ice pops</h2>
<p>An alternative to the store-bought ice pops is making them at home using fruit juice, drink mix, or any freezable beverage. A classic method involves using ice cube trays and toothpicks, although various ice pop freezer molds are also available.</p>
<h2>World record ice pop</h2>
<p>On June 22, 2005, Snapple tried to beat the existing <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>
 entry of a 1997 Dutch 21-foot (6.4&#160;m) ice pop by attempting to erect a 25-foot (7.6&#160;m) ice pop in New York City. The 17.5 short tons (15.9&#160;t) of frozen juice that had been brought from Edison, New Jersey in a freezer truck melted faster than expected, dashing hopes of a new record. Spectators fled to higher ground as firefighters hosed away the kiwi-strawberry-flavored mess.[6]</p>
