<title>Dundee cake - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Dundee cake</h1>
<p><b>Dundee cake</b>
 is a famous traditional Scottishfruit cake with a rich flavour.[1][2]</p>
<p>The cake is often made with currants, sultanas and almonds; sometimes, fruit peel may be added to it. The cake originated in nineteenth-century Scotland, and was originally made as a mass-produced cake by the marmalade company called Keiller's. Keiller's marmalade company first produced the cake commercially and have been claimed to be the originators of the term "Dundee cake".[<i>citation needed</i>
] However, similar fruit cakes were produced across Scotland. A popular story is that Mary Queen of Scots did not like glace cherries in her cakes, so the cake was first made for her, as a fruit cake that used blanched almonds and not cherries.[3] The top of the cake is typically decorated with concentric circles of almonds. Today, the cakes are often sold in supermarkets throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
