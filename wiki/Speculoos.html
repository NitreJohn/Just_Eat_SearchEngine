<title>Speculoos - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Speculoos</h1>
<p><b>Speculoos</b>
 (Dutch: <i>Speculaas</i>
Dutch pronunciation:[speːkyˈlaːs], French: <i>spéculoos</i>
, German: <i>Spekulatius</i>
) is a type of spiced shortcrustbiscuit, traditionally baked for consumption on or just before St Nicholas' feast in the Netherlands (December 5), Belgium (December 6),[1] and around Christmas in the western and southern parts of Germany. Speculoos are thin, very crunchy, slightly browned and, most significantly, have some image or figure (often from the traditional stories about St. Nicholas) stamped on the front side before baking; the back is flat.</p>
<p>Speculoos dough does not rise much. Dutch and Belgian versions are baked with light brown (beet) sugar and baking powder. German Spekulatius uses baker's ammonia as leavening agent. Spices used in speculoos are cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cardamom and white pepper. Most Speculoos versions are made from white flour, brown sugar, butter and spices. Some varieties use some almond flour and have slivered almonds embedded in the bottom. Some Belgian varieties use less or no spice.</p>
<p>To make the dough, butter, sugar and spices are combined. The flour and leavening agent are mixed separately and then added. Bakers carefully ensure the dough doesn't heat too quickly. The dough is stored in a cool place overnight to give the spices time to permeate the dough and add extra flavor.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>There are several interpretations for the origins of the name <i>Speculoos</i>
. It may derive from Latin<i>speculum</i>
, which means <i>mirror</i>
, and refer to the fact that the images are cut as a mirrored bas-relief into a wooden stamp which is then used to decorate the Speculoos. Another explanation of the name refers to the Latin word <i>speculator</i>
 which, among other meanings, could also refer to a bishop or St Nicholas' epithet "he who sees everything". <i>Specerij</i>
, the Dutch word for <i>spice</i>
, is another possible origin.</p>
<h2>Local varieties</h2>
<p>The Belgian city of Hasselt is known for a local variety of speculoos. On January 13, 1870 Antonie Deplée, a baker from Hasselt, acquired a license for Hasselt speculoos: "une espèce de pain d'amandes connu sous le nom de spéculation" (A kind of almond "bread" known under the name <i>spéculation</i>
.) He sold this version locally and abroad.</p>
<p>The German<b>Spekulatius</b>
, traditional in Westphalia and the Rhineland, is of the same origin and is very similar. It is popular throughout the country around Christmas and usually not available at other times of the year.</p>
<h2>Spread, paste, cookie butter</h2>
<p>By 2007, several Belgian and Dutch companies began marketing a paste variant of speculoos, now available worldwide under various brands and names: as <i>Speculla</i>
, <i>Cookie Butter</i>
, <i>Speculoos</i>
, <i>Biscoff Spread</i>
 or <i>Speculoospasta</i>
.</p>
<p>As a form of "spreadable Speculoos cookies, the flavor is caramelized and gingerbread-like with a color similar to peanut butter[2] and a consistency ranging from creamy to granular or crunchy.</p>
<p>The spread consists of 60% crushed speculoos cookies along with vegetable oils.[2][3]</p>
<p>In the area of Europe centered on Eeklo, Belgium, local workers had long known that a sandwich made in the morning with butter and speculoos cookies would develop a spread-like consistency by lunchtime.[<i>not in citation given</i>
][3]</p>
<p>In 2008, two competitors entered a contest on the Belgian television show, <i>The Inventors (de Bedenkers)</i>
, with a spread made from speculoos cookies[3][4] — Els Scheppers, who reached the semi finals, and the team of chef Danny De Mayer and Dirk De Smet, who weren't selected as finalists. Spreads made from crushed Speculoos cookies would subsequently go into production by three separate companies, and by the time they arrived in Belgian supermarkets, Speculoos spread caused a sensation,[3] taking the "Benelux market by storm."[4]</p>
<p>The companies manufacturing the spread were Biscuiterie Willems, Vermeiren Princeps and Lotus Bakeries of Belgium — with Lotus Bakeries subsequently claiming exclusive rights, having purchased the recipe from contestant Scheppers of the television competition.[3] The two competitors, Scheppers as well as De Mayer &amp; De Smet, had presented nearly identical speculoos-based spread recipes, with the latter claiming to hold a patent.[4] De Mayer/DeSmet's recipe was marketed beginning in November 2007 as <i>Speculla,</i>
 and Scheppers recipe by Lotus Bakeries arrived in early spring 2008 as <i>Speculoospasta.</i>
 Lotus subsequently also purchased the De Mayer/De Smet patent.</p>
<p>A two-year patent battle ensued between Lotus and Biscuiterie Willems[4] and in January 2011, Lotus Bakeries' patent was nullified[3][5] by the Commercial Court of Ghent (Belgium),[4] which discovered the recipe had been posted on an internet website, <i>Oma Wapsie (Grandma Wapsie),</i>
 since 2002.[6][7]</p>
