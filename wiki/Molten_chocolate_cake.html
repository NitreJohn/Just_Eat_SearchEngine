<title>Molten chocolate cake - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Molten chocolate cake</h1>
<p><b>Molten chocolate cake</b>
 or <b>lava cake</b>
 is a popular dessert that combines the elements of a flourlesschocolate cake (sometimes called a chocolate decadence cake) and a souffl√©. Some other names used are <b>chocolate fondant</b>
,[1]chocolate <i>moelleux<b></i>
</b>
 and <b>chocolate lava cake</b>
.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The United States-based chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten claims to have invented molten chocolate cake in New York City in 1987, but the French chef and chocolatier Jacques Torres has disputed that claim, arguing that such a dish already existed in France. According to Vongerichten, he pulled a chocolate sponge cake from the oven before it was done and found that the center was still runny, but was warm and had both a good taste and a good texture. Regardless of who invented the dish, Vongerichten has been credited with popularizing it in the United States, and it is now almost a <i>de rigueur</i>
 inclusion on high-end restaurant dessert menus.[<i>citation needed</i>

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Molten lava cakes are always baked in ramekin dishes and have four main ingredients: butter, eggs, sugar, and chocolate. The butter and chocolate are melted together, while the eggs are either whisked with the sugar to form a thick paste, producing a denser finished product; or are separated so the egg whites can be whipped into an egg foam to provide more lift (and thus a lighter cake) when the mixture is baked.</p>
<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>Rather than presenting only the cake itself in a ramekin or on a plate, the baker may choose to make the cake more appealing. Fresh raspberries, a drizzling of raspberry and/or chocolate sauce, and dustings of powdered sugar may be added to enhance flavor, or a sprig of mint may look more appealing as well. For a more intense chocolate taste, the baker may also add a tablespoon of strong coffee.</p>
