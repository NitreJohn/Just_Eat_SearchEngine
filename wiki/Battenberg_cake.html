<title>Battenberg cake - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Battenberg cake</h1>
<p><b>Battenberg</b>
[1] or <b>Battenburg cake</b>
[2] is a light sponge cake with the pieces covered in jam. The cake is covered in marzipan and, when cut in cross section, displays a distinctive two-by-two check pattern alternately coloured pink and yellow.</p>
<p>The cake is made by baking a yellow and a pink sponge cake separately, and then cutting and combining the pieces in a chequered pattern. The cake is held together by apricot jam and covered with marzipan.[3]</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>The origin of the cake is unclear,[4][5] with early recipes also using the alternative names "Domino Cake" (recipe by Agnes Berthe Marshall, 1898), "Neapolitan Roll" (recipe by Robert Wells, 1898),[6] or "Church Window Cake." The cake was purportedly named in honour of the marriage, in 1884, of Princess Victoria, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, to Prince Louis of Battenberg. The name refers to the town of Battenberg, Hesse in central Germany; it is the seat of the aristocratic family known in Britain as Mountbatten.[7]</p>
<p>According to <i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>
, the name "Battenberg cake" first appeared in print in 1903.[8] However, a "Battenburg cake" appeared in: Frederick Vine, <i>Saleable Shop Goods for Counter-Tray and Window â€¦</i>
 (London, England: Office of the Baker and Confectioner, 1898).[9][4]</p>
<h2>American variation</h2>
<p>In the United States there is a related confection called a <b>checkerboard cake</b>
, so named because, as with a Battenberg cake, when it is sliced open it resembles the board for the game draughts, known in the U.S. as "checkers," which is played on a "checkerboard". A typical checkerboard cake is one that alternates between vanilla and chocolate flavoured sponge cake and has a very rich chocolate buttercream icing; unlike the British Battenberg it does not typically use marzipan and utilizes a special springform pan to get the desired effect.[10]</p>
