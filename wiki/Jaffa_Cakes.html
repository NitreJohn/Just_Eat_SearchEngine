<title>Jaffa Cakes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Jaffa Cakes</h1>
<p><b>Jaffa Cakes</b>
 are biscuit-sized cakes introduced by McVitie and Price in the UK in 1927 and named after Jaffa oranges. The most common form of Jaffa Cakes are circular, 2&#160;1⁄2 inches (64&#160;mm) in diameter and have three layers: a Genoise sponge base, a layer of orange flavoured jelly and a coating of chocolate.[1] Jaffa Cakes are also available as bars or in small packs, and in larger and smaller sizes.[2] The original Jaffa Cakes come in packs of 12, 24 or 36.[3]</p>
<p>Because McVitie's did not trademark the name "Jaffa Cakes", other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name.[4] The product's classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991, with the court finding in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa Cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes.[5] In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the UK.[6]</p>

<h2>Manufacture</h2>
<p>McVitie's entire line of Jaffa Cakes are produced in the United Kingdom at the McVitie's factory in Stockport.[7] The Jaffa Cake production area covers an acre (4,000&#160;m2) and includes a production line over a mile (1.6&#160;km) long which sits on the Stockport side of the site's boundary with Manchester.[4] Because of the nature of the product – having multiple components of cake, chocolate covering and jam – special hardware accelerators were devised to allow rapid computer inspection of 20 products per second, taking place under four symmetrically placed lights.[8]</p>
<h2>Flavour variants</h2>
<p>Although Jaffa Cakes are usually orange flavour, limited edition flavours have been available, such as lemon-and-lime,[9] strawberry[10] and blackcurrant.[11]</p>
<h2>Categorisation as cake or biscuit for VAT</h2>
<p>In the United Kingdom, value added tax is payable on chocolate-covered biscuits, but not on chocolate-covered cakes.[12] McVities defended its classification of Jaffa Cakes as cakes at a VAT tribunal in 1991, against the ruling that Jaffa Cakes were biscuits due to their size and shape, and the fact that they were often eaten in place of biscuits.[13] McVities insisted that the product was a cake, and according to rumour produced a giant Jaffa Cake in court to illustrate its point.[13] The product was assessed on the following criteria:[14][15]</p>
<p>The court found in favour of McVities and ruled that the product should be considered a cake, meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa Cakes in the United Kingdom.[12][16]</p>
