<title>Lebkuchen - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Lebkuchen</h1>
<p><b>Lebkuchen</b>
 (or Pfefferkuchen) (German pronunciation:[ˈleːbˌku:xn]&#160;(listen)) is a traditional German baked Christmas treat, somewhat resembling gingerbread.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The etymology of the term <i>Lebkuchen</i>
 is uncertain. Proposed derivations include: from the Latin <i>libum</i>
 (flat bread), from the Germanic word <i>Laib</i>
 (loaf), and from the Germanic word <i>lebbe</i>
 (very sweet). Another likely possibility is that comes from the old term <i>Leb-Honig</i>
, the rather solid crystallized honey taken from the hive, that cannot be used for much beside baking. Folk etymology often associates the name with <i>Leben</i>
 (life), <i>Leib</i>
 (body), or <i>Leibspeise</i>
 (favorite food). 'Kuchen' means 'cake'.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The forerunner of today's <i>Lebkuchen</i>
 was called the "honey cake" and its history can be traced back to the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans. They believed that honey, the only sweetener widely available to them, was a gift of the deities and had magical and healing powers. Honey cakes were also worn as a talisman in battle or as protection against evil spirits.</p>
<p>Lebkuchen was invented by monks in Franconia, Germany in the 13th century. <i>Lebkuchen</i>
 bakers were recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm, and 1395 in Nürnberg (Nuremberg). The latter is the most famous exporter today of the product known as Nürnberger Lebkuchen (Nürnberg Lebkuchen).</p>
<p>Local history in Nuremberg relates that emperor Friedrich III held a Reichstag there in 1487 and he invited the children of the city to a special event where he presented Lebkuchen bearing his printed portrait to almost four thousand children. Historically, and due to differences in the ingredients, <i>Lebkuchen</i>
 is also known as <i>honey cake</i>
 (Honigkuchen) or <i>pepper cake</i>
 (Pfefferkuchen). Traditionally, the cookies are usually quite large and may be 11.5 cm (4.5 in) in diameter if round, and larger if rectangular.</p>
<p>Since 1808, a variety of Nürnberg Lebkuchen made without flour has been called <i>Elisenlebkuchen</i>
. It is uncertain whether the name <i>Elise</i>
 refers to the daughter of a gingerbread baker or the wife of a margrave. Her name is associated with some of the Lebkuchen produced by members of the guild. Since 1996, <i>Nürnberger Lebkuchen</i>
 is a Protected Designation of Origin and must be produced within the boundaries of the city.</p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p><i>Lebkuchen</i>
 range in taste from spicy to sweet and come in a variety of shapes with round being the most common. The ingredients usually include honey, spices such as aniseed, coriander, cloves, ginger, cardamom, and allspice, nuts including almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, or candied fruit.[1]</p>
<p>In Germany, types of <i>Lebkuchen</i>
 are distinguished by the kind of nuts used and their proportions. Salt of Hartshorn and Potash are often used for raising the dough. <i>Lebkuchen</i>
 dough is usually placed on a thin wafer base called <i>Oblate</i>
. This was an idea of the monks, who used unleavened communion wafer ingredients to prevent the dough from sticking. Typically, they are glazed or covered with very dark chocolate, but some are left uncoated.</p>
<p><i>Lebkuchen</i>
 is usually soft, but a harder type of <i>Lebkuchen</i>
 is used to produce <i>Lebkuchen</i>
<i>Hearts</i>
, usually inscribed with icing, which are available at many German fairs, and the <i>witch houses</i>
 made popular because of the fairy tales about Hansel and Gretel. The closest German equivalent of the gingerbread man is the <i>Honigkuchenpferd</i>
 (<i>honey cake horse</i>
).</p>
<p><i>Lebkuchen</i>
 is sometimes packaged in richly decorated tins, chests, and boxes which have become nostalgic collector items.</p>
