<title>Omelette - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Omelette</h1>
<p>In cuisine, an <b>omelette</b>
 or <b>omelet</b>
 is a dish made from beaten eggs quickly cooked with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around a filling such as cheese, chives, vegetables, meat (often ham), or some combination of the above. To obtain a fluffy texture, whole eggs or sometimes only egg whites are beaten with a small amount of milk or cream, or even water, the idea being to have "bubbles" of water vapour trapped within the rapidly cooked egg.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fluffy omelette is a refined version of an ancient food. According to Alan Davidson,[1] the French word <i>omelette</i>
 came into use during the mid-16th century, but the versions <i>alumelle</i>
 and <i>alumete</i>
 are employed by the Ménagier de Paris (II, 5) in 1393.[2]Rabelais (<i>Pantagruel</i>
, IV, 9) mentions an <i>homelaicte d'oeufs</i>
,[3] Olivier de Serres an <i>amelette</i>
, François Pierre La Varenne's <i>Le cuisinier françois</i>
 (1651) has <i>aumelette</i>
, and the modern <i>omelette</i>
 appears in <i>Cuisine bourgoise</i>
 (1784).[4]</p>
<p>According to the founding legend of the annual giant Easter omelette of Bessières, Haute-Garonne, when Napoleon Bonaparte and his army were traveling through southern France, they decided to rest for the night near the town of Bessières. Napoleon feasted on an omelette prepared by a local innkeeper that was such a culinary delight that he ordered the townspeople to gather all the eggs in the village and to prepare a huge omelette for his army the next day.[5]</p>
<h2>Records</h2>
<p>On March 19, 1994, the largest omelette (128.5 m²; 1,383&#160;ft²) in the world at the time was made with 160,000 eggs in Yokohama, Japan,[6] but was subsequently overtaken by another, weighing 2,950 kilograms (6,500&#160;lb), made by the Canadian Lung Association at the Brockville Memorial Centre in Brockville, Ontario, Canada on May 11, 2002.[7] In turn, that record was surpassed on August 11, 2012, by an omelette cooked by the Ferreira do Zêzere City Council in Santarém, Portugal. This record breaking omelette weighed 6,466 kilograms (14,255&#160;lb), and required 145,000 eggs and a 10.3 metre diameter pan.[8]</p>
