<title>Boston cream pie - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Boston cream pie</h1>
<p>A <b>Boston cream pie</b>
 is a cake that is filled with a custard or cream filling and frosted with chocolate.[1] Although it is called a Boston cream pie, it is in fact a cake, and not a pie.[2]</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Owners of the Parker House Hotel in Boston state that the Boston cream pie was first created at the hotel by Armenian-French chef M. Sanzian in 1856.[3] The cake he created, called "Parker House Chocolate Cream Pie", consisted of two layers of French butter sponge cake filled with crème pâtissière and brushed with a rum syrup, its side coated with crème pâtissière overlain with toasted sliced almonds, and the top coated with chocolate fondant.[4]</p>
<p>The commonly known variety is likely derived from the Washington pie, a two-layer yellow cake filled with jam and topped with confectioner's sugar, for which pastry cream of custard eventually replaced the jam, and a chocolate glaze replaced the confectioner's sugar.[2] Today, the cake is topped with a chocolate glaze (such as ganache) and sometimes powdered sugar or a cherry.</p>
<p>The first known attested printed use of the term "Boston cream pie" occurred in the <i>Granite Iron Ware Cook Book</i>
, printed in 1878.[2] The earliest known recipe of the modern variant was printed in <i>Miss Parloa's Kitchen Companion</i>
 in 1887 as "Chocolate Cream Pie".[2]</p>
<p>The Boston cream pie is the official dessert of Massachusetts, declared as such on 12 December 1996.[5]</p>
<h2>Other form</h2>
<p>A Boston cream doughnut is a name for a Berliner filled with vanilla custard or crème pâtissière and topped with icing made from chocolate.[6]</p>
