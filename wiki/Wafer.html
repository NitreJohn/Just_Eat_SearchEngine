<title>Wafer - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Wafer</h1>
<p>In gastronomy, a <b>wafer</b>
 is a crisp, often sweet, very thin, flat, and dry biscuit,[1] often used to decorate ice cream. Wafers can also be made into cookies with cream flavoring sandwiched between them. They frequently have a waffle surface pattern but may also be patterned with insignia of the food's manufacturer or may be patternless. Many chocolate bars, such as Kit Kat and Coffee Crisp, have wafers in them[<i>citation needed</i>
].</p>

<h2>Communion wafer</h2>
<p>The word also refers to the special small round, often starchy flatbreads made for Western Rite celebrations of the Eucharist, including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and some of the more liturgicalProtestant churches. The word "host" is used to describe the larger wafer used by the clergy, while the term "communion wafer" refers to the smaller pieces used to distribute Holy Communion to the people. These holy wafers often have an image of a cross or the crucified Christ imprinted on them.</p>
<h2>Spa wafers</h2>
<p>Special "spa wafers" (Czech: <i>lázeňské oplatky</i>
, Slovak: <i>kúpeľné oblátky</i>
) are produced in the spa towns of the Czech Republic (e.g. Karlovy Vary, Mariánské Lázně, etc.) and the Slovak Republic (e.g. Piešťany, etc.).</p>

<p>Christmas wafers, whose patterns often depict religious scenes, are an Eastern European Roman Catholic Christmas tradition celebrated in Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and Italian families during Wigilia (<i>Christmas Eve Vigil</i>
).</p>
<h2><i>Oblea</i>
</h2>
<p>A variation of a wafer, considered a part of the traditional cuisine in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, Venezuela, and México, is known as an <i>oblea</i>
. It is usually eaten as a dessert with two pieces filled with <i>arequipe</i>
, <i>dulce de leche</i>
 (milk caramel), and/or sweetened condensed milk in the middle. In some places, they might contain cheese, fruits, or chantilly cream, among others.</p>
<h2>Pink Wafer</h2>
<p>A <b>pink wafer</b>
 is a wafer-based confectionery originally made by Edinburgh's Crawford's Biscuits in the United Kingdom, and is now made by United Biscuits, the company that took over the firm in 1960, still using the Crawford's name. The snack consists of crème sandwiched between wafers (dyed pink).[2]</p>
