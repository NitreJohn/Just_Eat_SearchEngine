<title>Fat rascal - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Fat rascal</h1>
<p>A <b>fat rascal</b>
, closely related to the historical <b>turf cake</b>
, is a type of cake, similar to a scone or rock cake in both taste and ingredients. It originated in Yorkshire at least as early as the 1800s.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fat rascals were known in the Yorkshire region in the nineteenth century as a form of tea cake containing butter and cream.[1] An 1859 Charles Dickens story identifies the fat rascal with the singing hinny of Northumberland.[2] A fat rascal could also be baked as a turf cake, a buttery, flat cake baked in a covered pan among the ashes of a peat fire,[3] and the terms <i>fat rascal</i>
 and <i>turf cake</i>
 are sometimes used interchangeably. A 1980 Yorkshire cookbook described fat rascals as a means of using leftover pastry, typically consisting of scraps of shortcrust pastry, sugared, sprinkled with currants and rolled into thick flat cakes before baking.[4] Fat rascals, whatever their composition, do not appear to have been widely known outside the Yorkshire region until the 1980s, although there are occasional mentions in other regions, such as in Rye, Sussex in Ford Madox Ford's 1931 memoirs.[5]</p>
<h2>Bettys</h2>
<p>A widely recognised version of the Fat Rascal was introduced by Bettys Café Tea Rooms in North Yorkshire in 1983. This is a plump, fruity scone with a 'face' made from cherries and almonds based on a rock cake recipe, developed by Helen Frankel, then a buyer and marketing assistant at Bettys. Following its launch, the Fat Rascal quickly became Bettys’ best known and best-selling bakery product, selling over 375,000 per year.[<i>citation needed</i>
