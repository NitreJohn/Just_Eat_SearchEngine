<title>Alfajor - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Alfajor</h1>
<p>An <b>alfajor<i></b>
</i>
 or <b>alajú<i></b>
</i>
[1] (Spanish pronunciation:&#160;[alfaˈxor], plural <i>alfajores</i>
) is a traditional confection[2] found in some regions of Spain, the Philippines, and in parts of Latin America, including Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Southern Brazil, and Mexico.[3] The archetypal <i>alfajor</i>
 entered Iberia during the period of al-Andalus. It is produced in the form of a small cylinder and is sold either individually or in boxes containing several pieces.[4]</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>In Spain</h2>
<p>In Spain, there are a variety of different recipes for preparing <i>alfajores</i>
, but the most traditional contain flour, honey, almonds and several spices, such as cinnamon. <i>Alfajores</i>
 are most commonly sold around Christmas, but in Medina Sidonia, they are available year-round.[5][6] The traditional Spanish <i>alfajor</i>
 has been produced in this town (where it is called an <i>alajú</i>
) since ancient times, the recipe handed down from father to son.[7]</p>
<p><i>Alfajores</i>
 are still made by craftsmen in Medina Sidonia using natural ingredients that include honey, almonds, hazelnuts, sugar, flour, and breadcrumbs, and mixed with natural spices.[7] The manufacturing process has been respected following a recipe found by Mariano Pardo de Figueroa in 1786.[8] In Medina Sidonia, the annual production of approximately 45,000 kilograms is mostly consumed in the province of Cadiz, but they are also famous in Sevilla, Malaga and Huelva.[9]</p>
<p>On 15 September 2004, protected geographical indication was ratified by the <i>Consejo de agricultura y pesca de la junta de Andalucia</i>
[10] and published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>
 as <i>Alfajor de Medina Sidonia</i>
 on 6 March 2007.[11]</p>
<p>In the province of Cuenca, Spain, where the <i>alfajor</i>
 is called <i>alajú</i>
 it is made with almond, honey and figs, all wrapped in a wafer.[12] Medina Sidonia was the capital for the Arabic world of confection, where the <i>alfajor</i>
 has centuries of history with a recipe that has been transmitted from generation to generation.[13] In this town, there is an account of Mariano Pardo de Figueroa, a gastronomist better known by his pseudonym Doctor Thebussem, who documented the history of this sweet, wherein he wrote that on 2 July 1487, Enrique de Guzmán, second count of Medina Sidonia, ordered the council and majors of the region to send to Malaga 50 cows, 50 oxen, 200 calves and provision of <i>alajú</i>
 from his city.[14]</p>
<p>The recipe documented by the accounts of Thebussem in the 19th century is defined as the following:</p>
<p>"For the <i>alfajor</i>
 or <i>alajú</i>
 styling, prepare what I say: one quart of white honey, three means of a pound of hazelnuts and almonds, all roasted and chopped, half ounces of cinnamon, two ounces of aniseed, four drachms of cloves and a quarter of cilantro, roasted and ground coffee, a pound of roasted sesame, eight pounds of dust from grinding, out of bagels without salt or yeast, overcooked in the oven, with half a pound of sugar."[15]</p>
<h2>In South America</h2>
<p>In South America, more specifically the South Cone, due to the lack of habits,[<i>citation needed</i>
]<i>alfajores</i>
 were made totally differently. Nowadays, they are found most notably in Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Ecuador, Paraguay, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Brazil. The food has been popular in Argentina and Uruguay since the mid-19th century. However, these differ from the Spanish alfajores in that they are made with two round cookies with different sweet fillings between them. They can be covered in glaced sugar (Santafesinos), coco or chocolate. Argentina is today the world largest consumer of alfajores,[<i>citation needed</i>
] both in total numbers and in per capital calculations, being the most common snack for schoolchildren and adults.[<i>citation needed</i>
] In Argentina and Uruguay. Other nations from South America might import some from Argentina and Uruguay and have limited consumption. They usually contains traditional dulce de leche, although there are a lot of variations.</p>
<p>Some of the best known alfajor brands in South America are the Argentine <i>Havanna, Cachafaz</i>
 and <i>Jorgito</i>
 and the Uruguayan <i>Punta Ballena</i>
.</p>
<h2>In the Caribbean</h2>
<p>In Puerto Rico, they underwent creolization, lost their almond and gained ground cassava. They can take varying amounts of sugar and spices. It's possible that Puerto Rico's most common version of this dessert (South American version with dulce de leche) reached Puerto Rico from Venezuela, but the opposite is also possible. Depending on region some add cornstarch, citrus zest, ginger and honey, filled with chocolate, vanilla cream, dulce de leche, fruit paste, or coconut. The filling can be mixed with almonds, seasame seeds, coconut flakes, or sprinkles.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>According to Spanish philologist and dialectologist Manuel Alvar López, <i>alfajor</i>
 is an Andalusian variant of the Castilian <i>alajú</i>
,[16] derived from the Arabic word الفاخر, <i>al- fakhur</i>
, which is not known, neither found in América, where Andalusians introduced it as <i>alfajor</i>
,[17][18] from the Arabic word <i>alfahua</i>
 that means honeycomb.[19] Both words had been introduced into Spanish dictionaries in the 14th century.</p>
<p>The publication of the historical dictionary of the Spanish language allows us to document both, <i>alajur</i>
 very broadly written as <i>alajú</i>
 and <i>alfajor</i>
. <i>Alajur</i>
 and multiple geographic variations are sweets made of a paste of almonds, nuts, breadcrumbs and honey.[20] It is effectively possible that <i>alfajor</i>
 and <i>alajú</i>
 were Arabisms introduced into the Spanish language in different places and times, and, supposing both came from the same etymon, from the phonetic point of view, <i>alajú</i>
 is an Arabism of the Castillian, and so it is still alive in Cuenca, Toledo, Guadalajara and in <i>la Sierra de la peña</i>
 (France); meanwhile the variation <i>alfajor is</i>
 Andalusian and Murcian.[21] In the Americas, the meaning of the word <i>alfajor</i>
 was not known until the 19th century.[22]</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 712, the Arab general Musa ibn Nusair arrived in Algeciras with an army of 18,000 soldiers to undertake the conquest of Medina Sidonia, Alcalá de Guadaira and Carmona.[23] A similar sweet called <i>alajú</i>
 is found in the Arabic-Hispanic cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh, by an anonymous author. The Spanish grammarian Nebrija appointed the word for the first time in his Latin-Spanish Dictionary (1492) as: <i>alfaxor</i>
 or <i>alaxur</i>
. In the 12th century, Raimundo Martin describes in his book <i>Vocabulista</i>
 another possible etymology of the Hispano-Arabic <i>fasur</i>
, meaning "nectar".</p>
<p>The presence of this sweet is evident in the area of southern Peru during the 12th and 13th centuries,[24] being developed in Andalusia since the days of Al-Andalus until today. Due to the popularity of this food, they already were in the warehouses of the first ships of the Spaniards on their way to America. The earliest references to its presence in Latin America referred to Venezuela and Peru, where they were given as rations to the Spanish troops. The popularity of this sweet in the 16th century is reflected in literary works such as Guzman Alfarache.</p>
<h2>Preparation and presentation</h2>
<p>The regulations allow the use of only pure honey, almonds, nuts, breadcrumbs, sugar, flour and spices, such as aniseed, sesame, coriander, cloves and cinnamon. The Protected Geographical Indication <i>alfajores</i>
 are meant to be presented in a cylindrical shape, with a minimum weight of 30&#160;grams each, and with a minimum size of about 18&#160;cm in length and a diameter of 1,5&#160;cm. Each of them will be protected with a wrapping paper, and the ends made an ornament in a spiral shape with a ribbon out of the same paper. Once individually wrapped, they may be packaged in wood or cardboard boxes, but never in plastic.[25]</p>
<h2>Variations in the Americas</h2>
<p>In Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, its basic form consists of two round, sweet biscuits joined together with mousse, dulce de leche or jam, and coated with dark or white chocolate (many <i>alfajores</i>
 are sold in "black" and "white" versions) or simply covered with powdered sugar. These are also known as a Chilean <i>Oreo</i>
. One variation is called "<i>alfajor de nieve</i>
" (snow alfajor) and has a white coating consisting of a mixture of egg whites and sugar. Most <i>alfajores</i>
 come packaged in aluminium foil. Alfajores are made in various diameters and are consumed as snacks.</p>
<p>Peruvian try to make <i>alfajores</i>
 are usually coated in powdered sugar, as seen in the picture, and are filled with Manjar blanco (Not Dulce de leche). In Mexico, they are made with just coconut, and are normally a tri-color coconut confection. In Nicaragua, they are similar to the Canary island type of <i>alfajores</i>
 and are made with molasses and different grains including corn and cacao. They are often packaged in plastic wrap or wax paper.</p>
<p>The Brazilian try to make alfajor is more commonly known as "pão de mel" (meaning "honey bread" in Portuguese). This variety is also coated with dark chocolate - like in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile - but has a cake-like texture on the inside and can be filled with Dulce de Leche , chocolate and coconut cream.</p>
<p>Other varieties include different elements in the preparation of the biscuits, such as peanuts, and a variety of fillings, coatings, or even the addition of a third biscuit (<i>alfajor triple</i>
).</p>
<p>According to Guinness World Records, the biggest <i>alfajor</i>
 in the world, measuring almost two meters in diameter and 80 centimeters in height and weighing 464 kilograms, was made on 11 December 2010 in Minas, Lavalleja Department, Uruguay.[26] The giant <i>alfajor</i>
 was made to mark the celebration of Uruguay's first National Alfajor Festival. More than 30 people participated in the preparation of the record-breaking <i>alfajor</i>
.[27]</p>
