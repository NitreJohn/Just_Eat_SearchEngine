<title>Abernethy biscuit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Abernethy biscuit</h1>
<p>The <b>Abernethy biscuit</b>
 was invented by doctor John Abernethy in the 18th century as a digestive improver and hence aid to health.[1]</p>
<p>Abernethy believed that most diseases were due to disorders in digestion. The Abernethy biscuit is a type of digestive biscuit, a baked good originally designed to be eaten as a support to proper digestion.[2] In creating his biscuit, Abernethy was following in the footsteps of other medical practitioners, including William Oliver of Bath, Somerset (invented the Bath Oliver) and American preacher come nutrition guru Sylvester Graham (invented the Graham cracker).[3]</p>
<p>The Abernethy biscuit is an adaptation of the plain captainâ€™s biscuit or hardtack, with the added ingredients of sugar (for energy), and caraway seeds because of their reputation for having a carminative effect[4] and thus being beneficial in digestive disorders. The biscuit is a cross between an all butter biscuit and a shortcake, raising through use of ammonium bicarbonate.[5] According to <i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>
, a baker at a shop where Abernethy usually took lunch created the new biscuit at Abernethy's suggestion and subsequently named it after him.[6]</p>
<p>Abernethy biscuits remain popular in Scotland. They are manufactured commercially by Simmers (Edinburgh), Walls Bakeries (Shetland Islands), and by Stag Bakeries (Isle of Lewis).[7]</p>
