<title>Pączki - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Pączki</h1>
<p><b>Pączki</b>
 (/ˈpɔːntʃ<i>k</i>
i/, <b>PAWNCH</b>
<i>-ki</i>
, Polish: <i>pączki</i>
[ˈpɔnt͡ʂki]&#160;(listen)) or <b>paczki</b>
 are pastries (singular: pączek) traditional to Polish cuisine. They are similar to doughnuts.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pączki are deep-fried pieces of dough shaped into flattened spheres and filled with confiture or other sweet filling. Pączki are usually covered with powdered sugar, icing or bits of dried orangezest. A small amount of grain alcohol (traditionally, Spiritus) is added to the dough before cooking; as it evaporates, it prevents the absorption of oil deep into the dough.[1]</p>
<p>Although they look like German berliners, North American bismarcks or jelly doughnuts, pączki are made from especially rich dough containing eggs, fats, sugar, yeast and sometimes milk. They feature a variety of fruit and creme fillings and can be glazed, or covered with granulated or powdered sugar. Powidl (stewed plumjam) and wild rose hip jam[1][2] are traditional fillings, but many others are used as well, including strawberry, Bavarian cream, blueberry, custard, raspberry, and apple.[3]</p>
<p><i>Pączki</i>
 have been known in Poland at least since the Middle Ages. Jędrzej Kitowicz has described that during the reign of August III, under the influence of French cooks who came to Poland, pączki dough was improved, so that pączki became lighter, spongier, and more resilient.</p>

 or <i>oponki</i>
</p>
<p>Home-made glazed paczki</p>
<p>Assorted pączki (commercially produced near Detroit)</p>
<h2>Etymology and pronunciation</h2>
<p>The Polish word <i>pączki</i>
 is the plural form of the Polish word <i>pączek</i>
[ˈpɔnt͡ʂɛk].[4]<i>Pączek</i>
 itself is a diminutive of <i>pąk</i>
 (English: plant bud).[5][6]</p>
<p>In English, <b>paczki</b>
 serves as both the singular and plural term, though some speakers use "paczkis" for the plural.[7] Whereas sometimes the Polish spelling with the Polish letter <i>ą</i>
 is retained in English language publications,[1] many sources anglicize to <b>paczki</b>
.[5][6]</p>
<p>The common English pronunciation /ˈpɔːntʃ<i>k</i>
i/[6] (<b>PAWNCH</b>
<i>-ki</i>
) imitates the Polish phonology, though some speakers pronounce the word /ˈpʊntʃ<i>k</i>
i/[5] or /ˈpʌntʃ<i>k</i>
i/ (<b>PUUNCH</b>
<i>-ki</i>
 or <b>PUNCH</b>
<i>-ki</i>
).</p>
<p>Dictionaries translate <i>pączek</i>
 as <i>doughnut</i>
, <i>donut</i>
 and (botanically) <i>bud</i>
.[8][9] American-style doughnuts with a hole are sometimes known in Polish as <i>donaty</i>
[10][dɔˈnatɨ].</p>
<h2>Pączki Day</h2>
<p>In Poland, <i>pączki</i>
 are eaten especially on Fat Thursday (<i>Tłusty Czwartek</i>
), the last Thursday prior to Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent.[11] The traditional reason for making pączki was to use up all the lard, sugar, eggs and fruit in the house, because their consumption was forbidden by Catholic fasting practices during Lent.</p>
<p>In North America, particularly the large Polish community of Chicago, Detroit, and other large cities across the Midwest, Paczki Day is celebrated annually by immigrants and locals alike. The date of this observance merges with that of pre-Lenten traditions of other immigrants (<i>e.g.</i>
, Pancake Day, <i>Mardi Gras</i>
) on Fat Tuesday. With its sizable Polish population, Chicago celebrates the festival on both Fat Thursday and Fat Tuesday; pączki are also often eaten on Casimir Pulaski Day. In Buffalo, Toledo, Cleveland, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, South Bend, and Windsor, Pączki Day is celebrated on Fat Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Pączki Day celebrations in some areas are even larger than many celebrations for St. Patrick's Day.[<i>citation needed</i>
] In Hamtramck, Michigan, an enclave of Detroit, there is an annual Pączki Day (Shrove Tuesday) Parade,[3] which has gained a devoted following. Throughout the Metro Detroit area, it is so widespread that many bakeries attract lines of customers for pączki on Paczki Day.[12]</p>
<p>In some areas, Pączki Day is celebrated with pączki-eating contests. The contest in Evanston, Illinois, started in 2010, and is held on the weekend before Fat Tuesday, while Hamtramck's contest is held on the holiday.</p>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p>These pastries have become popular in the United States as a result of Polish immigrants and marketing by the bakery industry. Sold mainly for Fat Tuesday, they are particularly popular in areas where there is a large concentration of Polish immigrants: Philadelphia, the Greater Detroit and Mid Michigan areas, Central Connecticut, Greater Cleveland, Northern and Central New Jersey, Chicago and Northern Illinois, Northwest Indiana and Southeastern Wisconsin.</p>
<h2>Derivatives</h2>
<p>In other Slavonic countries, a meal synonymous with pączki appears in the local cuisines whose name is derived from the same etymology as <i>pączki</i>
:[13][14]</p>
<p>In other countries neighboring Poland similar desserts are called:</p>
<p>A similar food in Israeli cuisine is called the <i>sufganiyah</i>
