<title>Bizcochito - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>
<h1>Bizcochito</h1>
<p><b>Bizcochito<i></b>
</i>
 or <b>biscochito<i></b>
</i>
 is a crisp lard or butter based cookie flavored with cinnamon[2] and anise.[3] The name is a Spanish diminutive form of Bizcocho. It was developed by residents of New Mexico[4] over the centuries from the first Spanish colonists[5] of what was then known as Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico. The recipe for making the cookie has been greatly influenced not only by local and indigenous customs, but also by recipes brought to New Mexico by immigrants from other Hispanic countries.</p>
<p>It is served during special celebrations, such as wedding receptions, baptisms, and religious holidays (especially during the Christmas season).[2][6] It is commonly served along with hot chocolate.[6] The cookie is seldom known outside the boundaries of the original Spanish province, although Spanish speakers may recognize the association with Bizcocho, from the name, and may have some idea of what they must be, even if they have not encountered them before.[<i>citation needed</i>

<h2>State cookie</h2>
<p>In 1989, the U.S. State of New Mexico made the biscochito or bizcochito its official state cookie.[6][3] This act made New Mexico the first U.S. state to have an official state cookie.[3][7] It was chosen to help maintain traditional home-baked cookery.</p>
